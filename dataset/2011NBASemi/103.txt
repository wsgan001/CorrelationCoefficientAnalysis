ABOUT THE HEAT: After a modest regular season and a quiet second-round series against the Boston Celtics, Bosh has suddenly emerged as the biggest threat on a team with three of them. The 6-foot-10 power forward made 13 of his final 16 shots in Sunday¡¦s 96-85 victory in front of a raucous crowd at American Airlines Arena. Bosh finished with 34 points in the victory, nearly as many as superstar teammates LeBron James (22) and Dwyane Wade (17) had between them. Even more satisfying for Bosh was that he did most of his damage against Bulls counterpart Carlos Boozer, who suggested prior to the series that Bosh wasn¡¦t a star.

ABOUT THE BULLS: Rose needed plenty of help Sunday ¡V and he didn¡¦t get nearly enough. The league MVP struggled from the field as the Heat routinely double-teamed him, preventing him from driving to the basket. He and Boozer both shot 8 for 19 on the night, part of a 41-percent shooting performance from a team that is struggling to keep up offensively with the Heat. The team defense took a hit as well, with reserve center Omer Asik leaving the game in the second half with a strained muscle in his left leg. Asik, who is one of the Bulls¡¦ top defenders off the bench, did not return to the game and his status for Game 4 is up in the air.
