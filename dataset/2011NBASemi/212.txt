OKLAHOMA CITY -- The Dallas Mavericks got the message. They swarmed the Oklahoma City Thunder with defense and held them to four field goals on 23.5 percent shooting with six turnovers for a 27-12 lead after one quarter.

It's hardly the way this one figured to open with the Thunder playing their first home game in the Western Conference finals. But, they looked all of the inexperienced playoff team they are supposed to be while Dallas came out and executed its game plan.

The Mavs got widespread scoring as Dirk Nowitzki took just two shots and scored two points. Shawn Marion has eight points, Peja Stojakovic and DeShawn Stevenson each have five points and Jason Kidd knocked down his lone 3-pointer and has three assists.

Kevin Durant missed his first four shots and finished with six on 1-of-5 shooting.
