The Miami Heat are chalk-full of stars and their original one has stayed out of the spotlight in the past three games against the Chicago Bulls.

Chris Bosh was the top story in Game Three's victory with 34 very impressive points. The win before that it was LeBron James who took over late to ensure his team got the victory.

Wade hasn't been the spectacular player we have been accustomed to seeing in the Eastern Conference Finals. He's scoring 19.7 points on 42 percent shooting in the series. The numbers don't compare to the 24.7 points a game and 47 percent shooting of the first-two rounds.

Wade himself admits to the Miami Herald that he hasn't been playing great:

With the expected increase in attention to Chris Bosh, and the the newly found game manager/point guard LeBron James, signs point to Dwyane having the big performance in Game Four.

Keith Bogans has done a decent enough job on him, but odds are he can't stop "The Flash" four games in a row.

Wade went out for a late night workout to "work out some of the kinks in his offensive flow" last night. He is clearly bothered by his play and can be expected to come out and be extremely aggressive right from the tip.

Wade is poised to be the leading scorer and Player of the Game tonight in Miami.
