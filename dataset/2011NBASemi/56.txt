The last time the Miami Heat held an opponent below 40 percent shooting, won the rebound battle and allowed fewer than five three-pointers, they beat the Memphis Grizzlies by 33 points.

When they did that against the Bulls on Wednesday night, they won by 10 ¡X and needed a 12-2 run in the final 4:30 to do that.

The big news out of Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals was that this is an Eastern Conference finals SERIES. That¡¦s it. The Bulls had a chance take control of the series ¡X more than just ¡¥¡¥holding serve¡¦¡¦ ¡X with another convincing victory and failed. But the Heat didn¡¦t exactly turn the series around with their road victory. If Udonis Haslem¡¦s energy becomes the difference, the Bulls never should have been here in the first place.

The Bulls missed 14 of their first 16 shots. They shot 34 percent (28-of-82) from the field, 3-of-20 from three-point range (2-of-19 on threes excluding the Luol Deng desperation shot at the end of the first quarter). They missed 10-of-26 free throws and were outrebounded 45-41. Derrick Rose shot 7-of-23 from the field. And Kyle Korver and Keith Bogans ¡X among those usually responsible for picking up the slack when Rose is off his game ¡X combined to hit 2-of-9 three-pointers. And the Bulls still were tied 73-73 with less than 5:00 to play and trailed 78-75 with 2:29 to go.

The Heat showed some championship mettle by responding to a Game 1 disaster. But they had to work awfully hard to win a close game in the final five minutes. The four previous games they¡¦ve held an opponent below 40 percent shooting and fewer than five three-pointers, they won by 23, 14, 27 and 33 points.

All we know so far is that neither team has solved the other. The Bulls (26-15) and Heat (28-13) are two of the best road teams in the NBA, so home-court advantage isn¡¦t as big of a factor as it might be in a conference final.

Game 2 showed off the Heat¡¦s biggest advantage in the series ¡X if the Bulls give Dwyane Wade and LeBron James a chance to make the difference, they can do it. But they also had to have a lot of things go their way to get into that situation Wednesday night.

The good news: It¡¦s going to be a long, fun series to watch.
