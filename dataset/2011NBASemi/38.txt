Oddsmakers from online sports book Bodog.com have made the Bulls 2.5-point favorites over the visiting Heat tonight when the two teams square off in Game 2 at 8:30PM ET. The over/under total for this contest is currently sitting at 181.5 points.

The Bulls dominanted Game 1 of this series on Sunday. Derrick Rose paced Chicago with 28 points and six assists, while Luol Deng scored 21 points and added seven rebounds in the 103-82 victory.

The Heat wasted a great effort by Chris Bosh, who scored 30 points and grabbed a team-high nine rebounds in the loss. Dwyane Wade shot just 7-for-17 from the field in route to 18 points, while LeBron James added 15 points on just 5-of-15 shooting. He also finished with six assists to lead Miami.

NBA Free Pick: Even though the Bulls were the top seed in the Eastern Conference coming into the playoffs, I think the Heat underestimated Chicago in Game 1 on Sunday. Wade and LeBron may disagree, but it doesn¡¦t look like Miami was ready for the style of team basketball that Chicago brought to the floor a couple of nights ago. Furthermore, I wonder if the Bulls just have the Heat¡¦s number. According to latest NBA trends, the Heat are 1-4-1 against the spread in their last six trips to Chicago and 0-3-1 ATS in their last four games against the Bulls overall. Meanwhile, the home team is 6-2-1 ATS in the last nine meetings between these two teams and the Bulls are 5-1 ATS in their last six games as a favorite. Take the underrated Bulls tonight.
