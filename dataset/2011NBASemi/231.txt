OKLAHOMA CITY -- The Thunder could not have asked for a better-shooting half, connecting on 58.3 percent. The Mavericks will not be happy with 11 turnovers. At halftime, Oklahoma City leads it 59-54, but it must might be the Thunder shaking their heads in doubt.

They blew numerous opportunities to extend an 11-point lead, but never could. At the 4:37 mark, Serge Ibaka missed a jumper and then James Harden missed a layup. The Mavs scored the next five points to slice OKC's lead in half.

Kevin Durant (14 points) and Russell Westbrook (12 points) are 12-of-21 combined. Westbrook scored six of eight points in the middle of the quarter as the teams traded buckets. Durant was quieted after a monstrous dunk made him 5-of-5, hitting just one more field goal.

It was Dirk Nowitzki who went to work in the second quarter with 17 of his game-high 22 points. What about getting to the free throw line, you say? Nowitzki is 9-of-9 after being awarded just three free throws in Game 3.

Brendan Haywood was a boost after Tyson Chandler picked up two fouls. He was extremely active and had seven points, including five coming at the free throw line on eight attempts.

Considering the turnover problems and a Thunder team that was shooting 67 percent well into the first half, the Mavs have to feel as though they're in fine shape to control of the game in the second half.

OKC had a chance to go up 13, but James Harden couldn't convert a layup and the Mavs scored the next five points.
