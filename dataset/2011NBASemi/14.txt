It all begins tonight as Game 1 of the much-anticipated Eastern Conference Finals series is upon us. Will the Miami Heat or Chicago Bulls take Game 1? View Current NBA Playoffs Betting Odds

Oddsmakers from online sports book SBGGLOBAL.com have made the Bulls a slim 2-point favorite in the contest and the over-under is listed at 181. Game time is slated for 8:05PM EST.

Both teams were impressive most of the time during their respective semifinals series'. Top seed Chicago played shutdown defense in Game 6 to down the Atlanta Hawks on the road, while a 16-0 run completed Miami's Game 5 series-clinching victory over the Boston Celtics.

LeBron James keyed the late Heat rally in Game 5 with 10 points during the run as he perhaps put to rest questions of his clutch ability for good. On the other side, NBA MVP Derrick Rose keys everything for the Bulls and is currently averaging 28.8 points per game in the postseason.

According to the latest trends, Miami is 5-5 against the spread and 6-5 straight up versus Chcago over the past three seasons. Chicago went 36-5 at home during the regular season and is 5-1 in home games during the postseason.

NBA Playoff Odds: Chicago has been unbelievable at the United Center all season and it will be rocking tonight. Wade and James have been unbelievable during the playoffs, but asking them to win a Game 1 in such a hostile environment might be too much. Chicago plays the best defense in the NBA when it is committed to it and I think that plus a big effort from Rose wins them this one. If Wade or James is forced to guard Rose at times, that will only take away from what they can produce on the offensive end. I like the Bulls at -2 in this spot.
