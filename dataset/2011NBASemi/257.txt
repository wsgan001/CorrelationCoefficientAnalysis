OKLAHOMA CITY -- Kevin Durant's fifth consecutive basket to start Game 4, a resounding dunk that put the quick-trigger Thunder up 18-8 at the 7:24 mark. Thirty seconds later, Shawn Marion, the primary defender on Durant, took a seat to think things over.

Durant had dropped two pretty turnarounds, one on Jason Kidd, and pulled-up for a 15-footer. He was on fire and 40 points looked locked in his wheelhouse.

But after scoring 10 points in less than five minutes, he would make just four more field goals the rest of the game -- going 4-of-17 over the last 48 minutes of regulation and overtime -- and he matched his nine buckets with nine turnovers. His frustration at finding so little space to operate and a feeling that, like Dirk Nowitzki in Game 3, he wasn't getting the benefit of the whistle spilled onto his face and his body language. At one point in the third quarter, after a possession of body bumping with Marion, Thunder coach Scott Brooks had to calm Durant down during a timeout.
