Oddsmakers from online sports book Bodog.com have made the host Heat a 4.5-point favorite over the Bulls in Game 3 and the over-under is set at 179. Game time is set for 8:30PM EST.

Miami used a strong defensive effort in Game 2 to secure an 85-75 win at Chicago to even the series at 1-1. The Bulls were held to just 34 percent shooting as the Heat overcame a rough first quarter in the victorious effort. LeBron James paced the Heat with 29 points and Dwyane Wade 24 points.

Perhaps the most bizarre part of the game was in the fact that Miami scored just 14 fourth quarter points, but Chicago was unable to take advantage as it scored only 10 points during the same stretch of time.

According to the latest NBA trends, Miami is 6-6 against the spread and 7-6 straight up versus Chicago over the last three seasons. Nine of 13 games in this series have gone under the total over the last three seasons.

Of the more than 8,068 wagers placed on tonight¡¦s Game 3, 50% of the betting public has their money on the Heat -4.5. But that information is subject to change the closer we get to tip off, so make sure you click on the link provided to check out the latest NBA public betting information.
