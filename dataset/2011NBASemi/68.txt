LeBron James produced some more fourth-quarter magic to propel the Miami Heat to a scrappy 85-75 win over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday, evening their NBA Eastern Conference final at a game each.

Dead-locked at 73-73 late in the fourth and the Bulls on the charge, James took over, scoring nine of Miami's final 12 points to earn the Heat a split in the Windy City.

The best-of-seven series moves to South Beach for Games Three and Four on Sunday and Tuesday.

James finished with a game-high 29 points and 10 rebounds while Dwyane Wade contributed 24 points and nine boards.

Chris Bosh, the other member of the Miami's big three, chipped in with 10 points and eight rebounds.

Chicago got 21 points from Derrick Rose but the NBA's most valuable player had little help, Luol Deng the only other member of the Bulls to hit double figures with 13 points.
