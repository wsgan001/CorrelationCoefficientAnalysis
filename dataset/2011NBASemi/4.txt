Point guard Dwyane Wade is a Chicago native who has given generously to the community and he will still probably be booed mercilessly in Game 1 against the Chicago Bulls.

You see, Heat star LeBron James isn't the only one who pissed off his hometown in the offseason.

At the same time, Wade was being pursued by the Bulls and he declined to join Derrick Rose, instead opting to build a superteam with James and Chris Bosh in Miami.

While the Heat are that team practically everyone wants to lose, dating back to LeBron's "Decision," the Bulls are that team everybody can admire, sculpted around a hometown star in Rose and complemented with scrappers such as Joakim Noah.

While the Heat live and die with three stars on offense, the Bulls don't have that luxury. They have to play better than anyone defensively because they have little offense beyond Rose. They have to play harder than anyone, too, if they want to win a title.

As Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals gets started tonight in Chicago, listen to the reception the Heat get coming out of the tunnel.

Those aren't just the cries of Bulls fans.

Those are the cries of essentially everyone outside of Florida.

It's good vs. evil in the NBA.

What could be more dramatic than that?
