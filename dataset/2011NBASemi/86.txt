Oddsmakers from online sports book Bodog.com have made the host Heat a 4.5-point favorite over the Bulls for Game 3. The over-under is 179 and action will start on ESPN at 8:30PM EST.

Miami's defense was the story of Game 2 as it held the Bulls to just 49 points after the first quarter to secure an 85-75 victory, evening the series at 1-1 in the process. LeBron James poured in 29 points for the Heat and pulled down 10 rebounds. Dwyane Wade had 24 points and nine boards, while Chicago's Derrick Rose was held to 21 points on 7-of-23 shooting. The Bulls shot 34 percent as a team.

According to latest NBA trends, Miami is 6-6 against the spread and 7-6 straight up versus Chicago over the past three seasons.

NBA Playoffs Free Pick: The Heat have been downright nasty at home during the playoffs and that shouldn't change here. Maybe the Bulls can steal a Game 4, but I don't see it happening in this spot. Miami understands just as well as Chicago that defense wins titles and that was evident in Game 2. If the Heat can continue even close to that tough of a defensive effort, it could be a mountain to climb for the Bulls. I like LeBron, D-Wade, Bosh, and company to get the upper hand in Game 3 plus cover the -4.5.
