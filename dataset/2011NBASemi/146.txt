United Center, Chicago¡XIt was another defensive battle between the Heat and Bulls. The two teams ended a hard fought series with the Heat winning 83-80 and the Heat taking five games to end the Bulls season. Lebron James took the lead defensively and spent most of the 4th quarter guarding Bulls point guard Derrick Rose. It is very clear how bad James wants to win an NBA championship because he is doing everything he can to win. He has clearly taken a leadership role for the Heat and they are following.

¡§We all want to prove that we¡¦re the best player on the court. We know what kind of player that Lebron is. We know how badly he wants to be in this situation. He¡¦s back in the NBA Finals. He carries that pain to have come up short before everywhere he goes. That will help him, and that will help us as a team.¡¨
¡V Chris Bosh

Lebron James led all scorers with 28 points and added 11 rebounds and 6 assists. Dwayne Wade struggled at the beginning of the game, but converted on some very key baskets in the 4th quarter to end the game with 23 points and Chris Bosh added 20 points and 10 rebounds.

For the Bulls it was very disappointing to give up a late 12 point lead with a little over three minutes to go in the 4th quarter. Young point guard Derrick Rose will grow from this series as the Heat blanketed him defensively and made it very difficult for him to get going offensively.

¡§Everything is on me ¡X turnovers, missed, shots, fouls ¡K If anything, I¡¦ll learn from it. That¡¦s all I can do right now. The series is over.¡¨
¡V Derrick Rose

Rose led the Bulls with 25 points, but only shot 9-29 from the field. Loul Deng was his usual dependable self and scored 18 points. The Bulls definitely need to bring in some additional offense during the offseason if they want to continue on the road of success next season. Good luck to both teams.
