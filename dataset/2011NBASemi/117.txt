The Miami Heat remain undefeated at home in the 2011 NBA Playoffs, defeating the Chicago Bulls 101-93 in Game 4. The Bulls who were held in such high regards by so-called experts like TNT's Charles Barkley, have found themselves outmatched, outhustled and outplayed by the Heat, who are clearly the better basketball team.

With the game tied at 85 apiece, the Heat were poised to take the final shot of the game, when a questionable offensive foul called on LeBron James(notes), gave the Bulls possession of the ball with eight seconds to go. The Heat kept their composure, denying the Bulls and forcing the game into overtime.

In overtime, it was all about the Heat and LeBron as they pulled away from the Bulls. With their victory in Game 4, the Heat have virtually guaranteed themselves a spot in the NBA finals. The last time a team came back from a 3-1 deficit in the eastern finals was in 1981.
