OKLAHOMA CITY -- Noted Dallas nemesis Danny Crawford is the lead official for Monday night's Game 4.

The Mavericks have a 3-16 record in playoff games worked by Crawford, but they do have a one-game winning streak. The Mavs beat the Trail Blazers in Game 2 of the first round after Crawford's assignment to the game dominated headlines and sports talk throughout the day.

The Mavs had lost 16 of the previous 17 playoff games worked by Crawford.

Tony Brothers and Ken Mauer are the other officials on Crawford's crew. Mauer worked Game 1 of the Portland series, when the Mavs had a 19-2 free throw edge in the fourth quarter, which prompted complaints from Blazers coach Nate McMillan that cost him $35,000.
