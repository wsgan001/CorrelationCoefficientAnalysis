OKLAHOMA CITY -- The Thunder just can't shake the Mavericks. Even with a five-point possession that took the Oklahoma City lead back up to nine, Dallas kept things within reach thanks to a slump-busting quarter from Jason Terry.

Terry's nine points in the quarter -- with help from nine OKC turnovers -- closed the gap to 81-77 headed to the fourth quarter.

As strange as Game 3 was as Dirk Nowitzki and Terry struggled only to be picked up by their teammates, Nowitzki has shouldered the load with 26 points, but he had just four in the third after getting off to a fast start in the period.

Shawn Marion is doing a good of frustrating Kevin Durant. Like Nowitzki in Game 3, now Durant can't believe he's not getting any calls. He's still got 21 points on 7-of-11 shooting, but he made his first five shots of the first quarter. He is 6-of-7 from the free throw line.

OKC had a chance to go up 11 but couldn't do it, and the Mavs closed the quarter on an 11-4 run.
