The Dallas Mavericks are one win away from the National Basketball Association Finals after erasing a 15-point fourth-quarter deficit and defeating the Oklahoma City Thunder 112-105 in overtime.

Dirk Nowitzki scored 40 points to lead the Mavericks, who forced overtime with a 17-2 scoring run over the final 4:48 of regulation play last night at Oklahoma City Arena.

Dallas, which had trailed 99-84, then outscored the Thunder 11-4 in the five-minute overtime to take a 3-1 lead in the best- of-seven Western Conference finals. The Mavericks can reach the NBA Finals with a Game 5 win tomorrow in Dallas.

：We・re happy with this win, but it・s not over yet,； Nowitzki, who hit 12 of 20 shots and 14 of 15 free throws, said in a televised interview.

The Mavericks are 6-1 at home this postseason and have also won five straight road playoff games as they pursue their first NBA championship. Dallas has made 11 consecutive playoff appearances since billionaire Mark Cuban bought the team in 2000, getting as far as the NBA Finals in 2006 before losing to the Miami Heat.

：The thing about this team all year is it・s been a resourceful group,； Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said during a news conference. ：They keep believing and we・ve been extremely opportunistic. The way they hung in tonight was fantastic.；

The Western Conference champion will face the Heat or Chicago Bulls for the NBA title.
Heat Lead Bulls

The Heat hold a 2-1 lead in the Eastern Conference finals with Game 4 scheduled for tonight in Miami, where LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and the Heat have a 7-0 record this postseason.

The Mavericks trailed by 12 points in the first quarter last night and didn・t lead during regulation play.

Nowitzki scored 12 points, including two free throws with 6.4 seconds remaining, to tie the game at 101 and force overtime.

：We kept believing,； Nowitzki said. ：In the last couple minutes we got some great stops. We finally got rebounds and it helped us with our flow.；

With the score tied and 40 seconds left in overtime, Jason Kidd hit a three-pointer to put Dallas up 108-105. The Mavericks, who got 20 points from Jason Terry and 17 from Kidd, then sealed the win from the free throw line.

Kevin Durant led the Thunder with 29 points and 15 rebounds, yet also had nine turnovers. Russell Westbrook added 19 points while Serge Ibaka had 18 points and 10 rebounds.

Oklahoma City・s youth and postseason inexperience didn・t cause the fourth-quarter collapse, Durant said. The Thunder・s top four playoff scorers are 22 years old or younger, while the Mavericks・ three leading scorers are 32 and 33.

Oklahoma City missed 13 of 16 shots during the final five minutes of the fourth quarter and overtime.

：We had a couple turnovers, a couple quick shots and we missed some shots. We also had two bad fouls. Was that youth? I don・t know,； Thunder coach Scott Brooks said at a news conference. ：We・ve had some success all year playing with a young team. We have to execute better.；
