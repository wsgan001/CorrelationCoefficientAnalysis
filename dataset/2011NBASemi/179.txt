After entering the fourth quarter down 11, Oklahoma City clawed back. A 12-2 run put the Thunder within five at 106-101 after Kevin Durant's(notes) 12-foot jumper with 3:42 left to play.

Durant scored 40 for the Thunder, who led 27-20 after the first quarter but fell behind 55-48 by halftime after Dallas outscored Oklahoma City 35-21 in the second quarter.

Westbrook had 20 points, but the point guard finished with just three assists and struggled from the field, hitting 3-of-15 attempts. He did convert 14-of-18 from the free-throw line, and Durant was 18-of-19 as the Thunder went 37-for-43 (86 percent) as a team.

But as good as Oklahoma City was from the foul line, Dallas was even better. Led by Nowitzki's playoff record 24 consecutive free throws, the Mavs went 34-for-36 (94.4 percent) from the line.
