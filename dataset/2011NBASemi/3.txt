The Eastern Conference Finals couldn¡¦t have gotten off to a better start for a Chicago Bulls. On Sunday night, the Bulls manhandled the Miami Heat en route to a 103-82 win to take a 1-0 series lead on the road to the NBA Finals. And while the offense was solid, it was the Chicago defense that led the way as the Bulls closed down the Heat and held LeBron James and Dwyane Wade to just 33 combined points.

Chris Bosh scored a game-high 30 points for the Heat, but had little to no help. Wade added 18 and James had 15, but no other Miami players were in double-figures.

Derrick Rose scored a team-high 28 points in the win and was followed closely by Luol Deng, who added 21 points. Carlos Boozer added 14 points and nine rebounds, with Joakim Noah chipping in nine points and 14 rebounds. Taj Gibson added nine points and a poster off the bench.
