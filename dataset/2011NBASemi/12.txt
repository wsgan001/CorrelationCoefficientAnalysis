Unlike the shocking upsets that have taken the Western Conference by storm, the Eastern Conference has gone more according to form, with the top-seeded Chicago Bulls and the second-seeded Miami Heat negotiating their way through to the conference final.

Chicago got off to a bad start in their semi-final against the Atlanta Hawks, losing 103-95 in Game 1 at home. They bounced back with wins in Games 2 and 3 but the Hawks levelled the series with a 100-88 triumph in Game 4. Chicago's class showed eventually, as they took out the fifth and sixth games to seal their progress.

Derrick Rose continued his imperious form for the Bulls, leading the way in points in five out of six games, including a 44-point haul in Game 3. Joakim Noah and Carlos Boozer were equally handy, weighing in with their fair share on the board.

Surprisingly, Miami had a far more comfortable route to the Eastern Conference final, against the third-seeded Boston Celtics who were expected to pose much more of a challenge.

The Heat took a 2-0 lead before Boston got on the board with a 97-81 win in Game 3. However, it only took Miami two more games to close out the series, with 98-90 and 97-87 victories.

Once again, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James were superb for the Heat, while Chris Bosh and Joel Anthony weighed in with their fair share of rebounds.
