DALLAS -- It wasn't the youthful Oklahoma City Thunder who made the first push, but rather the elder and overly rested Dallas Mavericks getting off to a 10-3 start. But, give OKC credit. It settled things down behind Kevin Durant and holds a 27-20 lead at the end of one.

Most notable for the Mavs is their 3-point shooting, which was great against the Lakers, is off to perhaps a rusty start, 0-of-6. Dirk Nowitzki had 10 quick points, but Dallas went the final 5:26 of the quarter with one field goal and four points and OKC went on a 12-4 run.

The Thunder had six turnovers, but the Mavs converted for just two points while the Thunder cashed in four points on five Mavs turnovers. Durant has 13 points and capped the quarter with a beautiful coast-to-coast drive after grabbing a J.J. Barea miss and finishing with a layup at the other end at the buzzer.
