The Heat got what they hoped for in the first two games in Chicago: a split. Miami got a 13-point performance from Haslem, as the Miami pulled off the 85-75 win at United Center.

LeBron James also was a big reason for the victory. The star forward scored 29 points, including some important shots in the fourth quarter, as the Heat prevailed to even the series, 1-1.

James also contributed 10 rebounds, five assists and three steals in the win.

The Bulls didn't get the type of performance they were hoping from Derrick Rose. The Bulls point guard scored 21 points, but shot just seven-of-23 from the field.

Chicago shot just 34 percent from the field. The Bulls also were out-rebounded, and didn't shoot well from the free-throw line.

But the Bulls real problem was Haslem. The Heat have struggled with their bench play, and Haslem was able to shoot five-for-10 from the field, and added five rebounds. 

Haslem, who has battled injuries this season, came up big in the second half, after the two teams played a tight first half. At one point he played about 10 minutes in a row, after playing just four minutes in Game One.

Aside from Rose, Luol Deng was the only player to score double-figures in the low-scoring game. Deng scored 13 points, but shot just five-of-15.

The series heads to Miami for Game Three on Sunday
