Both teams have remarkably similar numbers in the 2011 playoffs. Miami is scoring 94.7 PPG on 43.8% FG, while Chicago has 94.9 PPG on 43.7% FG. Defensively, the Miami Heat are allowing 88.8 PPG on 43.3% FG while the Bulls have been slightly better, giving up just 87.7 PPG on 42.7% FG. Chicago is clearly the better rebounding team, though, with a +7.8 RPG margin in the playoffs (+5.5 RPG for Miami) and a +22 rebounding margin in the three meetings with Miami this season.

The Big 3 vs. Big "D"

The Heat・s All-Star trio has not disappointed in the 2011 playoffs. LeBron James has averaged 26.1 PPG (28.0 vs. Boston), 9.4 RPG and 4.9 APG, while Dwyane Wade has 26.2 PPG (30.2 vs. Boston), 7.6 RPG and 5.0 APG, and Chris Bosh has 16.3 PPG and 9.6 RPG.

James and Wade also had great offensive success against Chicago this season, combining for 56.5 PPG, 15.0 RPG and 9.2 APG. James shot 56.4% FG against Chicago, while Wade made 44.4% (4-for-9) of his three-point attempts. Miami made 13-of-28 three-pointers in its first meeting with Chicago, but only went 5-of-21 in the final two games. The Heat defended the perimeter well versus the Bulls, holding them to just 14-of-54 (26%) shooting from downtown.

Rose to prove why he is MVP

The Chicago Bulls continue to be led by league MVP Derrick Rose, who has scored 28.8 PPG in these playoffs. He also has 8.2 APG in the postseason, including 32 assists and just eight turnovers in the past three games. Rose was also great against Miami this year with 29.0 PPG and 6.3 APG in the three meetings.

Luol Deng and Carlos Boozer both shot an identical 19-of-41 (46.3%) versus the Heat this season, as Deng averaged 16.7 PPG, 6.0 RPG and 4.0 APG, while Boozer had 13.3 PPG and 9.7 RPG. The duo has been a bit inconsistent in the playoffs, with Boozer・s 11.8 PPG and 9.5 RPG and Deng・s 16.7 PPG and 6.5 RPG. But Boozer is coming off a great Game 6 clincher in Atlanta where he scored 23 points (10-16 FG) with 10 rebounds and five assists. Joakim Noah only has 19 points in his past four games, but is still averaging nearly a double-double in the playoffs (9.9 PPG, 10.4 RPG).
These teams are very evenly matched as Chicago now has 70 wins and Miami has 66. The Heat are 14-3 since April began, including 8-2 SU (6-4 ATS) in the playoffs, while the Bulls are 16-3 since April, including 8-3 SU (6-5 ATS) in the postseason. Miami has been a great road team this year (30-15 SU, 26-18 ATS) and Chicago has the best home record SU (41-6) and second-best ATS home mark (27-19).

I expect this game and Conference Final series to be close throughout, but since the Bulls play superior defense, are a better rebounding team and are playing at home, I・m taking Chicago to post the victory on Sunday. Two more NBA betting trends supporting the Bulls to win and cover in Game 1 are :

CHICAGO is 26-13 ATS (66.7%, +11.7 Units) when playing against a team with a winning record this season. The average score was CHICAGO 95.6, OPPONENT 90.9 - (Rating = 2*).

CHICAGO is 42-22 ATS (65.6%, +17.8 Units) after having won 4 or 5 of their last 6 games this season. The average score was CHICAGO 97.9, OPPONENT 88.9 - (Rating = 2*).

The Under is 10-3 in the past 13 meetings between these teams, and NBA odds reports also side with the Under for Sunday・s Game 1.
