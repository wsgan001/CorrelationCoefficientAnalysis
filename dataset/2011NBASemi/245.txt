There was no way this group of die-hard Mavericks fans were going to bed.

Not after a stunning fourth-quarter comeback that resulted in a 112-105 overtime win over the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals.

A crowd of nearly 200 people welcomed the team back at a private facility on the east side of Dallas Love Field, with cheers erupting when the Mavericks team plane landed around 1:30 a.m.

¡§I didn¡¦t stop watching the game,¡¨ said Daisy Martinez, when the Mavericks were down 15 points with five minutes to go. ¡§I¡¦ll watch them win, and I¡¦ll watch them lose.¡¨

Moments after the plane landed, players and coaches were driving their cars through a tunnel formed by fans near the parking lot exit.

Fans eagerly snapped pictures as owner Mark Cuban , and players like Dirk Nowitzki, Tyson Chandler and J.J. Barea all waved and smiled at the crowd.

¡§You want to be a part of this experience,¡¨ said Priscilla Garcia. ¡§And they all had their phones out recording us too.¡¨

Some of the players even rolled down their car windows and high-fived the fans standing along the driveway.

Fans were understandably giddy, with the Mavericks now just one win away from a Western Conference title and a spot in the NBA Finals.

Game 5 is Wednesday at 8 p.m. at the American Airlines Center.

¡§We¡¦ve got this,¡¨ said Andrew Contreras, who brought his stepson along with him to welcome the team back. ¡§After this game, we¡¦ve got so much confidence we¡¦ll blow them away Wednesday.¡¨

Manuel Schuett is in Dallas visiting from his hometown of Hamburg, Germany.

He said he keeps up with the Mavericks, even though all of their games air overnight due to the time difference between Dallas and Germany. After Monday¡¦s big win, he was ready to look at the big picture.

¡§Dirk wants a ring, and I think he¡¦ll get the ring this time,¡¨ Schuett said.
