It was simply amazing to watch. Dirk Nowitzki(notes) of the Dallas Mavericks had one of the greatest performances in the history of the NBA Playoffs. After a long layoff, many thought that the Mavericks would have some rust. That was anything but the case. Behind the memorable night from Nowitzki, Dallas held off Kevin Durant(notes) and the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 1. I had mentioned before how excited I was for this series. Game 1 just proved why.

Nowitzki's line is just stunning. He had 48 points on 12-15 shooting. He was also 24-24 from the free throw line, an NBA record. The fact that Dirk could score that many points while attempting only 15 shots says all we need to know. That kind of shooting percentage is something that LeBron or Kobe can only dream about. Nowitzki has been the best player in the playoffs, bar none. He is a man on a mission, probably realizing this is his last great chance to get a ring. He was so good that he made a strong Kevin Durant performance irrelevant. Durant shot 10-18 for 40 points, but it wasn't anywhere near enough.

Nowitzki is the kind of player every NBA fan should enjoy watching. He is a big guy who can shoot the ball. He can also do all of the other little things that make an NBA player great. In a sport where too many stars whine and stroke their own ego, it is refreshing to watch guys like Nowitzki and Durant. Durant obviously has a lot of great years ahead of him. For Nowitzki, the years are numbered. But it should be cleat to every NBA fan that he is the best player in the playoffs right now. He's playing better than Durant, LeBron, Wade, and Derrick Rose(notes). This was the best of his many great performances. If he can play even a fraction as good the rest of the way, he might just get that elusive NBA title.
