ll season, the Heat was mocked for its late-game failures, including the 1-for-19 shooting when tied or trailing by three or fewer in the final 10 seconds and a 6-15 record in games decided by five points or less. But since the down-to-the-wire Game 4 loss at Philadelphia, the Heat¡¦s clutch play hasn¡¦t simply been good. It¡¦s statistically staggering.

Eight of the Heat¡¦s 12 playoff games have been very tight in the fourth quarter. We analyzed what Miami did in those games after the final time the score was tied (or, in the case of one game that wasn¡¦t tied, ahead by one).

In that time (36 minutes), the Heat outscored the 76ers/Celtics/Bulls by a stunning 92-41, with opponents shooting 24 percent (14 for 58).

The Heat ended playoff wins with runs of 9-2, 22-17 and 5-0 against the 76ers; 22-11, 12-4 and 10-0 against Boston and 12-2 against Chicago. All but nine of the Heat¡¦s points in those clutch moments came from LeBron James (35), Dwyane Wade (31) and Chris Bosh (17). Wade scored most of them against the 76ers (16 to James¡¦ six), but James has 19 of Miami¡¦s last 22.

So what has changed for James in the clutch? During the last five minutes of games with a margin of five or less, James shot 5 for 21 on three-pointers during the season. But he¡¦s 4 for 9 in the playoffs, including two threes that put the Heat ahead to stay in its past two victories. ¡§It¡¦s gratifying,¡¦¡¦ he said Saturday. ¡§When you¡¦re put in those situations time after time, you¡¦re going to miss some.¡¨

Before the postseason, most Heat fans would have preferred Wade take those ¡§clutch¡¨ threes ¡X he was 6 for 14 on threes in that scenario this season, 0 for 1 this postseason. James¡¦ overall ¡§clutch¡¨ shooting has dropped from 44 percent in the regular season to 42 because he¡¦s 6 for 15 on two-pointers. But he and Wade (4 for 12 on twos) get to the free-throw line, and the shots they¡¦ve made have been huge.

James gets a bad rap on clutch play. When Sports Illustrated asked 168 NBA players this year who they want shooting for their team with the game on the line, James got no votes. Kobe Bryant got 74 percent, even though he¡¦s 5 for 20 with a chance to tie or take the lead in the final 10 seconds in his playoff history. James is 5 for 13, Wade 2 for 2.

Here¡¦s another reason for Miami¡¦s much improved clutch play: The Heat has allowed an incredible 66.2 playoff points per 100 opponent possessions in the last five minutes of close games (margin of five or less). During the season, Miami gave up 109 in clutch time and 100.7 overall - three off Chicago¡¦s league lead.

That¡¦s a credit to James and Wade (who both stopped Derrick Rose in the fourth quarter of Game 2), Joel Anthony and others. And Wade¡¦s playoff ¡§clutch¡¨ rebounding has jumped from 7.6 to 18.0 per 48 minutes.

¡E Udonis Haslem said Saturday he¡¦s not sure he could have returned this soon from his foot injury if he had signed elsewhere. But he has been pushed by the memory of his mother, who wanted him to re-sign with the Heat ¡X which he did shortly before she died from cancer last July. So many have reached out to Haslem since Game 2 (fans, players such as James Posey and Marquis Daniels). After Game 2, Pat Riley ¡§told me he loves me, that I¡¦m a warrior. He couldn¡¦t believe I went after it like that in my first¡¦¡¦ extended minutes.
