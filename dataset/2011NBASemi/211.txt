OKLAHOMA CITY -- The passion the Mavericks left in the locker room in Game 2 has been spilled all over Oklahoma City's home court in a dominant first half that has Dallas leading 52-36.

The Mavs' bulge was built with Dirk Nowitzki tied with Brendan Haywood in scoring with four points. Add that Jason Terry is 1-of-6 from the floor and it wouldn't seem possible that they'd head to the locker room with this type of cushion. But, credit the Mavs's defense, which held OKC to 29.4 percent shooting while cashing in a dozen points off nine Thunder turnovers.

Dallas did give the Thunder a little life at the end of the half. The Mavs led 52-31 before giving up five in a row, plus a rare third free throw on a foul after made Kendrick Perkins free throw. Haywood, who has bounced back from an awful Game 2 to play sensationally in Game 3, took down Nick Collison after the made free throw and Collison made the extra free throw to cut it to 16. Dallas led 27-12 after the first quarter.

Shawn Marion has 12 points to go with two steals and block. Jason Kidd has six points on two 3-pointers. Peja Stojakovic and Terry have seven points as the Mavs' bench, outscored 50-29 in Game 2, is quadrupling the Thunder's bench, 20-5.

Kevin Durant is having a horrific shooting game as the Mavs are making him work for everything. He's just 2-of-10 and one of his buckets was a difficult baseline jumper over Tyson Chandler. Durant is 6-of-6 from the free throw line for 10 points. Russell Westbrook has 12 points, but three more turnovers and two assists.

James Harden is 0-of-5 after his spectacular shooting display in Game 2.

The Mavs can't get complacent here. The Thunder have to feel good about being down 16 after going down by 23 earlier in the second quarter. And if 23 sounds familiar it should. That was the deficit the Portland Trail Blazers rallied from in Game 4.
