We live-blogged Game 2 of the Western Conference finals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder tonight. (Broadcast on ESPN.) Check out how OKC ended Dallas' 7-game winning streak in the playoffs and evened the series at 1-1.

11:59: Final Thunder stats. Durant had 24 points on 11-for-23 shooting and was 0-for-5 on threes. Harden was huge, with 23 off the bench, including 4 threes. That propelled the Thunder bench to 50 total points, compared to 29 for the Mav reserves. Maynor also was essential to the reserve production, with 13 points, but equally important was that he had zero turnovers while running the show for most of the fourth quarter. Scott Brooks is going to get big kudos for having the courage to stick with his second-string in the crucial minutes. Westbrook sat out the fourth quarter, even though he had 18 points on 7-for-15 shooting in 28 minutes. But he did have 4 turnovers. Game 3 will be Saturday at OKC.

11:55: Final Dallas stats: Nowitzki had a game-high 29 on 10-for-17 shooting. His free throw streak ended at 39 as he was 9-for-10 at the line. He didn't shoot a three and still hasn't hit one in two games. Jason Kidd had 13 points, including 3 threes plus 7 assists, 5 rebound and 5 steals, and only one turnover. Jason Terry had 8 early but nothing late. Mavs shot 43.8% and was 9-for-27 on threes.

11:49: Back in a couple with all the final stats.

11:47: Nowitzki finished with 29 and Durant had 24, but the key points were the 23 scored by OKC's James Harden off the bench, in 32 minutes. He was 6-for-9 overall and 4-for-7 on threes, plus 7 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 steals.

11:45: Game over. Oklahoma City evens the series at 1-1 with a 106-100 victory. The Thunder sealed it by playing mostly reserves throughout the fourth quarter.

11:43: Stojakovic can't hit the three. Sefalosha rebounds for OKC and gets fouled. 8.4 seconds left. Sefalosha hits both. 6-point Thunder lead.

11:41: Thunder lose the handle, don't get a shot. Horrible possession. 12.7 seconds left, Dallas timeout. Dallas down by 4.

11:39: Collison hacks Nowitzki and fouls out. Nowitzki gets three shots. Close call on that. 36.7 seconds left. He makes the first and -- gasp -- misses the second, but sinks the third. Dallas within 4.

11:36: Collison draws another foul, from Nowitzki. 47.6 seconds left. This time he hits both his FTs. Thunder lead back to 6, and timeout Dallas.

11:35: Stevenson at the line for Dallas. Hits two, Mavs within 4 with a minute left.

11:34: Obvious foul, and Collison goes to the line with 1:19 left. Misses both. So much for being the NBA's best team at the line.

11:32: OKC commits its first turnover of the fourth quarter, but then Jason Kidd throws it into the stands. Timeout, 1:30 left, Thunder up 102-96, and OKC is sticking with his reserves.

11:29: Nowitzki, off the glass. He has 12 in the quarter, 25 in the game. Durant misses, and Nowitzki powers to the basket for another deuce. Dallas down 6, under 2 minutes left.

11:25: Maynor zips through the lane and OKC has its biggest lead of the night, 100-92, with 3:45 left. OKC playing with reserves, except for Durant. And then Harden hits again to put OKC up by 10. Timeout, 3:15 left.

11:24: Deft move backing in by Nowitzki. He has 10 in the quarter and 25 for the game. But next time down Nowitzki gets blocked by Collison. Thunder up 6.

11:20: Durant hits and runs his total to a game-high 24. Dallas needs a timeout with the Thunder leading 95-90, 5:50 left.

11:17: Barea puts himself in the X-factor conversation with his third 3. Not a lot of defense tonight, but the shootout is definitely on. A lot different from Game 1, when action at the free throw line dominated the scoring.

11:16: Harden bombs in another 3. He has 21 and Thunder are up 4. That's 4 threes for Harden, who's looking like tonight's X-factor.

11:15: Harden goes coast-to-coast to put Thunder up three but can't hit the plus-one. Nowitzki answers with his fourth basket of the quarter. Dallas back within one. 7:50 left.

11:11: Nowitzki hits his second fourth-quarter basket but Durant answers with one of his own. And then Nowitzki hits again on a slick fadeaway. Timeout with 8:46 left in the game and Thunder up 86-85.

11:08: J.J. Barea makes it a 1-point game with his second three. Those are his first points of the second half.

11:07: Nowitzki opens the fourth quarter with a basket but Collison answers with a jam off an OR. OKC leads by 4.

11:06: Through three quarters: Nowitzki has been held to 13 points and has shot only 7 times. Chandler leads the Mavs with 15. Kidd right behind with 13 plus 7 assists, and he has hit 3 threes. Durant leads everybody with 20 but is 0-for-4 on threes. Westbrook very strong with 18 points on 7-for-15 shooting. Thunder shooting 52.8% to Dallas' 44.8%. Thunder leading on the boards, 29-26.

11:01: Harden hits a three for the Thunder to tie it and has a chance for the 4-point play. Hits that and OKC is up by one as the third quarter ends.

11:00: Under a minute left in the third and Shawn Marion puts Dallas up by one with a tough basket underneath.

10:58: Stojakovic hits his second three and gets the Mavs back within 1.

10:53: Tyson Chandler gets Dallas back within 2 on a tip-in. He has 15 and is headed for a double-double, with 9 rebounds so far. Thunder still up, but only by 71-69. Timeout with 2:21 left in the third.

10:56: Who isn't contributing? J.J. Barea hasn't scored in the second half and has just 5 for the game. Stevenson has only 3 points in 19 minutes on 1-for-5 shooting, and zero rebounds. Perkins has been good for only 4 points and 4 rebounds, and has 4 personals.

10:50: Another long jumper by Westbrook. He has 18 -- same as Durant -- on 7-for-13 shooting.

10:49: Sefalosha zips through the lane on a good feed from Westbrook. Thunder up 4, 3:48 left in the third.

10:47: Durant lowers a shoulder and gets called for an obvious charge. Stevenson hits and Dallas ties it at 65-65.

10:44: Jason Kidd hits his third three and has 11 points. That's 8 more than he contributed in Game 1. Dallas back within 5.

10:40: Durant gets open with a great razzle-dazzle move and hits the basket. OKC opens the second half with a 6-0 run and leads by 8. Dallas timeout with 8:50 left in the third.

10:39: Westbrook grabs a loose ball and hits again, from long range. The 6-point lead is OKC's largest of the night.

10:37: Third quarter under way. Westbrook hits a wide-open jumper for a 61-57 Thunder lead to get things going.

10:26: OKC halftime stats: Kevin Durant leads everybody with 16 points on 7-for-12 shooting, but he's 0-4 on threes. Westbrook has been much better than in Game 1, with 12 points on 4-for-8 shooting. He has 3 assists, but also 3 turnovers. Harden looms as tonight's X-factor with 9 points and 4 rebounds. Most of his scoring has come at the line, where he's 6-for-6. Thunder are 16-18 from the line, and this series has to be on pace to set some records for free throw shooting. Thunder are shooting 55.6%, and are 3-for-10 on threes.

10:22: Dallas halftime stats: Doesn't look like Nowitzki will have another 40-point game. He has 13 at the half, and is still perfect from the line, 7-7 tonight. He also has 4 assists, but only one board. Tyson Chandler has been strong with 11 points and 8 rebounds. Jason Kidd has hit two threes and has 8 points plus 5 assists. Mavs are shooting 50%, and are 13-15 from the line, but only 4-for-13 on threes.

10:16: Kidd misses the Hail Mary at the horn and the Thunder head to the locker room with a 59-57 lead. Back in a couple with halftime stats.

10:15: Durant hits a soft jumper and that's 16 for him, and his first points of the second quarter. Westbrook adds a basket and the Thunder are up by 2.

10:13: Nowitzki back at the line for two more and of course he hits both of them. That's 38 in a row.

10:09: James Harden hits a three to tie, but Chandler gets a great feed from Kidd to keep Dallas ahead by 2.

10:07: Nowitzki gets to the line for the third time, so he's way behind his Game 1 pace. But he hits two and his playoff streak is at 36. Dallas up by 3 with 3:35 left in the second.

10:05: An Ibaka dunk gets OKC within one as Dallas calls a timeout with 3:49 remaining in the half.

10:02: Game gets a little sloppy. Dallas misses twice from short range underneath, and Thunder toss it away a couple of times. Dallas leading 48-45. Just over 4 minutes left in the half.

9:57: Nowitzki hits from far away for his first points of the second quarter. And then he feed Chandler for a basket. Dallas back in charge, 48-43. Timeout with 5:35 left in the half.

9:54: Barea sinks a bomb from the corner for his first three. All tied at 42 with 7:34 left in the half.

9:52: Jason Terry gets to the rim and Stojakovic adds a jumper. But Mavs still trail by one with 7:57 left in the half.

9:47: Harden hits two free throws and we're tied at 35-35 with 10:08 left in the half. OKC is 11-12 from the line. They were down 11 in the first quarter. And Maynor adds a bucket for a Thunder lead, 37-35. Timeout.

9:45: Haywood gets a nice slam for Mavs but then draws his third foul in 2 minutes at the other end. Dallas lead is down to 35-33.

9:43: First quarter stats: Durant had 14 but was 0-for-3 on threes. Nowitzki had 7 and Jason Kidd was good for 6 on a pair of threes, plus 4 assists. Dallas turned it over two times, OKC three. OKC led on the boards, 12-9.

9:38: Stojakovic misses the long attempt at the horn. First quarter ends with Dallas ahead 31-26. Mavs have to feel good, but Thunder regrouped just in time when it was on the verge of getting out of hand.

9:36: J.J. Barea is in the house and gets his first basket.

9:34: Durant comes flying in from the wing for a jam, but gets a technical for some trash talk after the basket. Nowitzki hits the free throw, and Durant hits the plus-one. Dallas still leads 29-22. Under a minute left. Durant adds another basket, and has 14.

9:30: Stojakovic hits a rainbow-arc three. Jason Terry drives for another basket and the Mavs are up 28-17. Under 2 minutes left in the first.

9:27: Timeout, 3:38 left in the first, Mavs still lead, 23-17.

9:25: Nowitzki gets an early rest. Jason Terry is in and draws a quick foul. He hits 2 FTs, and Dallas is up 23-13 with 4:09 left in the first.

9:21: Perfect alley-oop pass from Kidd to Tyson Chandler for a sensational jam. And then Kidd and Chandler repeat it. Is there an echo in there? Mavs up 21-11 and a very lost OKC team needs another TO. 5 minutes left in the first.

9:20: So far, Durant has 7, Nowitzki and Kidd have 6 and Marion checks in with 5. Dallas is shooting 50%, OKC 55.6%.

9:17: Nowitzki adds a bucket, and the Thunder breaks down for an additional basket. Mavs up 17-11 and OKC needs a timeout with 6:06 left in the first.

9:15: Nowitzki makes his first trip to the line and naturally hits two. He ended the Lakers series with 7 straight, had 24 in Game 1 and now adds two more. That's 33 in a row.

9:13: Durant drills a short J. He already has 7 points, with 7:39 left in the first.

9:12: Durant hits one of two at the line. Nowitzki buries his first jumper. Mavs up 11-9.

9:10: Jason Kidd for a three. And Durant answers with a fastbreak two. But there's Kidd with a second three. He already has topped his Game 1 scoring.

9:10: Durant misses his first shot, but Westbrook is there for the OR and feeds Durant for the follow. 2-2.

9:08: Dallas is 6-0 at home in the playoffs. The Thunder haven't lost two in a row in this postseason. Something has to give tonight. And we're under way, as Dallas strikes first with a bucket from Shawn Marion.

9:04: Magic Johnson is predicting a triple-double for Russell Westbrook tonight. His ESPN colleague, Jon Barry, also says there will be a triple double, but that it will belong to Jason Kidd. If there indeed is a T-D, I think Westbrook is the far stronger candidate. Can't see Kidd getting 10 boards on those 38-year-old legs.

8:55: Mavs will be going for their eighth consecutive playoff victory tonight. And they'll seek that win at home against a team that hasn't been all that great on the road during the postseason. Thunder are 2-4 away from home during the playoffs.

8:50: Waiting for tipoff. Lot of chatter on ESPN about whether Nowitzki needs a championship to get included in the debate about "10 Greatest Players Ever." I don't think he's there, even with one ring. He was amazing in Game 1, but that's one game.
