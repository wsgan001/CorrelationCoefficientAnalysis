The Oklahoma City Thunder tied the National Basketball Association・s Western Conference finals at one game apiece with a 106-100 win against the Dallas Mavericks.

Kevin Durant scored 24 points for the Thunder and James Harden went 4-for-7 on 3-pointers and added 23 points as Oklahoma・s bench combined for 50 points, compared with 22 in the first game of the series.

Dirk Nowitzki, who had 48 points in the previous game, didn・t score in the third quarter and was held to 29 points, while Tyson Chandler had 15 points and 13 rebounds last night for the Mavericks at American Airlines Center in Dallas.

：We made it a little tougher for him,； Durant said, referring to Nowitzki.

The Thunder are looking to reach the NBA finals for the first time since they relocated from Seattle in 2008. The franchise won its sole NBA title in 1979, as the SuperSonics, and last made the finals in 1996. Dallas lost to the Miami Heat on its only trip to the championship series, in 2006.

The series now moves to Oklahoma City for games tomorrow and May 23. The winner of the best-of-seven series will face the Heat or Chicago Bulls in the finals. That series resumes in Miami on May 22, with the teams tied at 1-1 in games.
