The Miami Heat find themselves in a 1-0 hole after being taken to school by the Bulls in the first game of this series and it will be up to LeBron James to make things right.

 

Chicago executed its gameplan to near perfection in the opener, out-rebounding the Heat 45-33 and breaking the game wide open in the second-half.

 

Miami outscored its opponents 102.1-94.6 (7.5 PPG) during the regular season, the best scoring differential in the league, so obviously coming off a 21-point loss is unfamiliar territory.

 

The oddsmakers opened the line for Game 2 at Bulls (-1.5) but the money has steadily come in on the favorite and the current line at Betjamaica is Bulls (-2.5) with a total of 181.5.

Chicago・s win-loss percentage after a win this season was .754 but the Heat have responded with an ATS win four out of five times following a loss. Miami was held to 85 points or less only seven times this year and the Heat are 6-1 straight-up in their next outing, going 3-1-1 ATS immediately after a loss by double-digits.

 

ROAD RULES

Dwyane Wade was held to 18 points Sunday, his lowest production in nine games. Wade・s road production had already been notably lower than his numbers at American Airlines Arena in Miami but for the Heat to have success, Wade will need to get back in range of his previous four playoff road games (26.3 points, 8.3 rebounds).

 

Chicago・s bench outscored the Heat 28-15 in Game 1, which was normal against the Celtics, but so was getting 30-plus points out of James. His 15 points scored in Game 1 matched his playoff low (May 7), but James answered back with 35 points and 14 assists and as the Heat look to even the series, we should see him get more involved.

 

NBA PICKS

James averaged 21.6 shots per game against the Celtics and shot .472 from the floor. His numbers during the regular season against Chicago were top shelf (25 PPG, .564 shooting, 9 rebounds and 7 assists), and with the amount of times we・ve seen him come up big in the clutch, we like the odds with the underdog.
