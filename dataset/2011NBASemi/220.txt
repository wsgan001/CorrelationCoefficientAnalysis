The Dallas Mavericks took a 2-1 lead in the National Basketball Association・s Western Conference finals with a 93-87 win against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Dirk Nowitzki and Shawn Marion each scored 18 points for the Mavericks last night at Oklahoma City Arena.

：He・s the best,； Dallas guard Jason Kidd said of Nowitzki. ：Even if he・s not making shots early, he wants the ball to make a play.；

Russell Westbrook had 30 points and Kevin Durant got 24 points and 12 rebounds for the Thunder.

The Thunder are looking to reach the NBA finals for the first time since they relocated from Seattle in 2008. The franchise won its sole NBA title in 1979, as the SuperSonics, and last made the finals in 1996. Dallas lost to the Miami Heat on its only trip to the championship series, in 2006.

The series continues tomorrow in Oklahoma City. The winner of the best-of-seven series will face the Heat or Chicago Bulls in the finals. That series resumes in Miami today with the teams tied at one win each.
