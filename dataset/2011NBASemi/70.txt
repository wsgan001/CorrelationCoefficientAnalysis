CHICAGO -- Two guys had two days to find themselves for Game 2.

The result was LeBron James and Dwayne Wade were two-rrific.

After the stars had their worst combined outing in their first season as Heat teammates, they changed that in a hurry. James scored 29 points and Wade added 24 as Miami defeated Chicago 85-75 Wednesday night at the United Center to tie the Eastern Conference finals at one game apiece.

In a 103-82 loss Sunday in Game 1, Wade managed just 18 points, more than seven below his regular-season average, and James scored a meager 15, nearly 12 under his average. Wade shot 7 of 17 and James 5 of 15.

：We had a couple of days off to stew over it,・・ Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ：I・ve seen it enough with Dwyane and now this year with LeBron that they respond and often play their best when their back is against the wall, under adversity, when they need to come back and help the team win.・・

The combined 33 points by the two Sunday marked their second-lowest output since James teamed with Wade. But a Nov. 22 game against Indiana, in which they combined for 28 points, featured only Wade playing poorly. He shot 1-of-13 for just three points while James had 25.

In only one previous game this season had both James and Wade both scored less than 20 points. But that 97-72 win over Detroit on Dec. 1 hardly counts since James, who scored 18 points, and Wade, who had 16, combined to play just 49 minutes in the rout.

So Sunday・s game was their ugliest as teammates. James and Wade had two days off between games to make up for it.

Did they ever.

James shot 12 of 21 from the field. Wade was 8 of 16.

：You just got to be more aggressive,・・ James said before Wednesday・s game. ：Out of 15 shots [Sunday], I think 10 of them may be jumpers. I will be more aggressive getting into the paint.・・

James wasted no time in living up to his vow. He scored 17 points in the first half while Wade had 14.

The two slowed down for a while in the second half. But James hit a three-pointer with 4:28 left in the game to put the Heat up for good at 76-73. That started a 12-2 game-closing run that featured James scoring nine points and Wade three.

：I tried to remind [James that] you cannot afford to get tired for us to have a chance to win,・・ Spoelstra said. ：We can・t have you fatigued.・・

That didn・t happen for either James, who played 46 minutes, or Wade, who logged 40.

James had 10 rebounds and Wade had nine, their total of 19 more than the double the nine they combined for in Game 1.

：It was a great two-way effort,・・ Spoelstra said of James and Wade playing both offense and defense.
