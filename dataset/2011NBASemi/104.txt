The Chicago Bulls look to even things up in Game 4 against the Miami Heat.

The Heat remained unbeaten in the post season after defeating the Bulls 96-85 in Game 3 of the best of seven series on Monday night. Despite missing his first three shots, Chris Bosh finished with 34 points, while LeBron James added 22 and 10 assists as the Heat once again pulled away in the fourth quarter to come away with the win.

Dwyane Wade added 17 points and nine rebounds for Miami, which is 7-0 at home in the playoffs and handed the team that finished with the NBA's best record its first losing streak since early Feb. Carlos Boozer had his best game of this post season, finishing with 26 points and 17 rebounds, but it wasn't enough as the Bulls faded late for the second straight game.

The over is 5-0 in Heat last five home games and 6-0 in Heat last six playoff games as a favorite. The under is 6-1 in Bulls last seven games as an underdog of 5.0-10.5, but the over is 12-3-1 in Bulls last 16 playoff games as an underdog of 5.0-10.5. Head to head, the Heat are 5-2 ATS in the last seven meetings in Miami while the home team is 7-3-1 ATS in the last 11 meetings. The under is 11-5 in the last 16 meetings.

Take away the fourth quarter in Game 2, in which both teams combinded to score a total 24 points, and you will find that both the Heat and Bulls have been scoring at a relativly high rate in the three games to date. Neither team is going to set any scoring records in this series, but we should see another performance like we did in Games 1 & 3, with both games going over the same total set for tonight...
