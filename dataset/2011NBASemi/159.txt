Lost in all of the love for Dirk's night should not be the performance of JJ Barea. A player who certainly was not appreciated locally in many corners until he brought the Lakers to their knees in several games in the last round, Barea again showed that there is not much of an answer for his game, either. Again in the 4th Quarter, Barea led the Mavericks in points. 12 points in 7 minutes for the Quarter, and 21 points in 16 minutes for the game. His game fits so perfectly with the Mavericks roster because he slices and dices and if you leave him for a second, you are leaving a shooter open. The lineup consists of JJ, a big man (either Chandler or Haywood) and then 3 shooters from a group of Terry, Kidd, Stojakovic, Nowitzki, and Stevenson. Leave any of them open and he kicks. Don't leave any of them and JJ takes it all the way to the rim. This offense is pretty special with Barea at the wheel. Again, you can only use him in doses, but it fits like a hand in a glove with the roster they roll out right now. And we have yet to see a defense that has the right answer for the Mavericks and their proper spacing. And if he is going to hit his 3's? Well, then forget it. Then, you can no longer go underneath the screens.

* His 28 fouls in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals. 55 fouls called in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals. Having watched both games, I might argue that both games seemed very physical. So, why did one set of officials "let them play" and the other game featured 79 free throws? Let's ask Joey Crawford and the gang. I felt that the parade to the free throw line was ridiculous and hopefully not a sign of things to come. We need more consistency in officiating, but I suppose that is something many of us have been saying for about 30 years now. It is what it is. Surely, it helps Nowitzki's and Kevin Durant's efforts to be protected against bumps and hand checks, but at some point, it would be nice if the game could find a flow. Constant whistles do not allow for that.

* There may not be any way to slow down Durant for the Mavericks. They also took many turns in trying to figure out a way to keep him from firing in another easy looking release jump shot from somewhere inside 30 feet. He is another physical marvel and given that he is 22 years old, we should get used to seeing his great performances this time of year, I suspect. I have no idea how that frame can sustain the physical beating from the NBA, but he makes it look easy. It is a rare night when 40 points is not enough to capture headlines, but you would be foolish to not suspect he will win a game or two in this series all by himself.

* It took 70 seconds of this 7 game series for Tyson Chandler and Kendrick Perkins to begin their showdown. I suspect that we will all be wildly entertained as those two warriors attempt to lay claim on the paint and the rim. It would be quite foolish to forget Perkins' playoff resume and his tough-guy persona is no act. Chandler, meanwhile, is the driving emotional force of this team, and 3 points and 8 rebounds may not jump off the page, but if you watch the game you see how important he is to the defense and overall swagger of the Mavericks. He challenges every shot and as awesome as that can be, you would like to recommend he picks his spots a bit more because he seems to be in foul trouble every single game. The good news is that unlike Erick Dampier and his consistent 4-fouls-before-the-4th-Quarter performances, you can see some very obvious byproducts of Chandler's rim ownership and intimidation. He changes the game.

* From a Thunder perspective, they are within 5 points late in the game with very little contribution from Russell Westbrook (3 for 15 from the field) and James Harden. Both are substantial threats to steal games with a phenomenal performance so you can understand some level of optimism for Game 2. Durant is going to be Durant, but they can really attack the Mavericks with those other two scoring threats. Game 1 was not their best showing, but it is a long series.

The Mavericks used their 9 day rest to look ready to roll last night. The Thunder looked like their were moments of fatigue and frustration at not being able to slow down Nowitzki and the gang. But, Oklahoma City's big goal in the early trip in this series is to get a split - something they will attempt to accomplish on Thursday.

If Dallas can continue to get a huge advantage from their bench scoring and if they can continue to ride on the back of their superstar, this series should go according to plan. But, the teams are just breaking a sweat.

Meanwhile, the Mavericks' "Redemption Tour" of 2011 is rolling right along. 9 playoff wins are in the bag and this team has not lost a game since April 23rd.

The scoreboard showed a video last night that offered the message that "This Year is Different." It sure feels that way.
