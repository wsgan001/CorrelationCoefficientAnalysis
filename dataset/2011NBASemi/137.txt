Chicago, IL (WGR 550)  -- Once Ronnie Brewer hit a three pointer to put the Chicago Bulls up by 13 with 3 minutes and 15 seconds remaining in game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals at home, Bulls fans rested easy at the United Center, waiting for the game to finish and send the series back to Miami for game 6.

The "big three" of Miami had other plans however, and stormed back in the game's final minutes to win 83 to 80 and punched their ticket to the NBA Finals Thursday night.

LeBron James was stellar on offense and defense, scoring 28 and preventing the Bulls' Derrick Rose from gaining any 4th quarter momentum.  The Heat outscored the Bulls 26 to 18 in the 4th quarter as a whole.

With about 90 seconds remaining, Heat guard Dwayne Wade shot a three pointer and forced a foul.  The four point play cut the Bulls lead to three at 79 to 76.  LeBron James followed with a 25 foot three point shot to bring the game to a 79 point tie.  

A possession later, the Heat captured the lead for good, with a 21 foot fadeaway jump shot from LeBron James to take the lead at 81 to 80.  The Bulls had no timeouts with about 15 seconds left. Strong Heat defense forced a desperation 3 point shot from Derrick Rose to tie the game sailed short, and the Heat took the game and the series after being down at least 13 points in the 4th quarter.

The Miami Heat and Dallas Mavericks meet for a chance to win the NBA championship.  It is a NBA Finals rematch of the 2006 series, where the Heat captured their only league title in six games.
