After so much preseason debate and conversation, the Miami Heat are on their way to the NBA Finals.

LeBron James had a big night in Game Five, scoring 28 points, and adding 11 rebounds, and six assists, in the 83-80 victory over the Chicago Bulls at United Center.


The game was marked by the amazing comeback by Miami. The Bulls led by 12 points with roughly three minutes remaining. But Dwyane Wade broke out of his slump, as the Heat went on a big scoring run, and shut down the Bulls' offense.

Derrick Rose finished with 25 points and eight assists, but had a poor shooting night.

The Heat were able to contain the Bulls' three big men: Joakim Noah, Carlos Boozer, and Taj Gibson, who combined to convert just three shots.

Chris Bosh scored 20 points, and had 10 rebounds for the Heat.

The Heat's next opponent will be the Mavericks, who staged an improbable comeback in two straight games to make it to the Finals.

Take a look at the highlights, and see how the Heat went on their run.
