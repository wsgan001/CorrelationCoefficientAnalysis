OKLAHOMA CITY -- Dirk Nowitzki has struggled mightily, but he picked a great time to nail his first 3-pointer of the series. The Thunder trimmed the lead to 13 points when Nowitzki buried a 3 from the top of the arc to take the lead back to 16.

Dallas holds a 70-56 lead headed to the fourth quarter. It was a strange third quarter with OKC outscoring Dallas 20-18.

Kevin Durant continues to struggle. He had a chance to cut the deficit to 12 late in the third, but he rushed a 3-pointer and missed it. He's missed all eight of his attempts from long range. Nowitzki has just eight points.

Shawn Marion leads the Mavs with 16 and Jason Kidd has 12.
