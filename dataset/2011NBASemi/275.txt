DALLAS ¡V Kevin Durant and several other Oklahoma City players stuck up for heavily criticized point guard Russell Westbrook after the Thunder¡¦s playoff run came to an end.

Yet perhaps the most passionate defense of Westbrook came from the Mavericks¡¦ locker room.

Shawn Marion shot down a question about Westbrook¡¦s shot selection. Matrix points out that Westbrook attempting 28 shots in Game 5 should be considered evidence that he¡¦s a point guard trying to save possessions, not that he¡¦s a selfish player.

¡§He didn¡¦t have any choice but to shoot some of those shots, because we were denying everybody else the ball,¡¨ said Marion, the Mavs¡¦ primary defender on Kevin Durant. ¡§When you deny everybody else from catching the ball, he ain¡¦t got no choice but to go one-on-one.

¡§Don¡¦t talk bad about that man, because he¡¦s competing out there and he¡¦s playing hard on both ends of the floor. When you deny people from catching the ball, he¡¦s got no choice but to shoot it. Don¡¦t kill him. I don¡¦t like that. He is out there playing hard and competing.¡¨
