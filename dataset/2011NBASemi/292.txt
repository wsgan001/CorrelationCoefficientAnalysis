Dirk Nowitzki hit another huge 3-pointer, as well as some more clutch free throws to finish with 26 points on 8-of-15 shooting, along with nine rebounds as the Mavericks came back late to beat the Thunder 100-96 and win the Western Conference Finals 4-1.

Dirk hit all nine of his free throws and was the key for the Mavericks this series. Shawn Marion also scored 26 points tonight, and played amazing defense in all five games. The Mavs were on a mission against the Thunder and now have a date for the Finals, likely facing the Miami Heat. Obviously, Dirk will need to stay hot for that matchup - especially with the Heat or Bulls holding home court advantage.
