LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and company are just one victory away from marching into the championship series, where they would meet the Mavericks, a repeat of the 2006 finals, which the Heat rallied to win.

Miami are currently 3-1 up in their Eastern Conference final seven-game-series against the Chicago Bulls after their thrilling performance in Game 4 in Florida Tuesday night.

Again it was James, who took over down the stretch, much like he did in Game 3 to complete the overtime win, while the league・s MVP Derrick Rose, struggled to make shots he normally knocked down easily for the Bull.

The Heat is also loving the way Bosh is looking, as he tries his hardest to make his own superstar mark, rather than being recognized as the third wheel in the ：Big Three.；

But heading back home, the likes of Luol Deng, Rose and Carlos Boozer, will want to guide Chicago to the win that would expend the season.

：I really believe we・ve got a group of guys that are going to keep on fighting,； Deng said. ：There・s no quit in us.

：There・s no quit in that locker room. It・s really going to come down to the end of the game again.；

Rose added: ：We still have games to play. Thibs (Tom Thibodeau) talked to us in the locker room about it, where we・re going back to play at home, and we have to stay positive, where they are beatable.

：But we just have to make sure that we play together and the turnovers have to be down, play defense.；
