The Miami Heat and Chicago Bulls are knotted at one game a piece in the Eastern Conference finals. They'll meet on Sunday from Miami in game three of their series.

The Chicago Bulls took game one of the 2011 Eastern Conference finals last week with a 103-82 win from the United Center. With the 21 point spread the Bulls, who swept the season series, looked as though they were setting a tone for the conference finals.

Chris Bosh, not Dwyane Wade or Lebron James, led the Heat in game one with a game-high 30 points as Derrick Rose led Chicago with a team-high 28 points.

The Heat, a team considered by many to be over-rated, looked like they were in trouble heading into game two. But pressure helps some teams rise to the occasion and, much in need of a victory, Miami tied the series at one game each with a 85-75 win over the Bulls on Wednesday.

Derrick Rose, one again, led Chicago with 21 points but Lebron James, as he should, stole the show. James posted a game-high 29 points, a game-high 10 rebounds, and a team-high 5 assists.

Even with Miami losing game one by a huge spread the Heat have to be happy about the situation they're in. They have earned a split from the first two games and if they can now defend their home court for two games, they will then have a 3-1 lead in the series.
