DALLAS | Dirk Nowitzki hit a three-pointer and Shawn Marion followed with a three-point play in the final 1:14 as Dallas rallied again to eliminate Oklahoma City 100-96 on Wednesday night in the Western Conference finals.

For the second consecutive game, the Thunder self-destructed down the stretch after losing game four in overtime.

：I just think we played hard and just couldn・t come up with the win,； Oklahoma City・s Russell Westbrook said.

But at some point the Thunder might look back at the series against the Mavericks, a veteran-filled team focused on another championship chance, as a big learning experience.

：I just know that we played together as a team throughout the whole series, and just couldn・t come up with the wins,； Westbrook said.

Marion, who・ll be making his first NBA Finals appearance, finished with 26 points and eight rebounds. Nowitzki also had 26.

Dallas has never won a championship, and neither has any of its players. Nowitzki and Jason Terry were part of the only Mavericks team to make the finals in 2006. They were up 2-0 and leading late in game three, but lost the series to the Miami Heat in six games.

Dallas may well get another crack at the Heat.

LeBron James and Miami lead the Chicago Bulls 3-1 in the Eastern Conference finals. If the Heat win tonight, the finals will begin Tuesday in Miami. If the Bulls win tonight, the finals will begin next Thursday in the East winner・s city.

：All I can tell everybody is: We ain・t done yet,； Mavs owner Mark Cuban said at the on-court trophy presentation ceremony. Seconds later, fans began chanting, ：Beat the Heat,； drowning out coach Rick Carlisle・s on-court interview.
