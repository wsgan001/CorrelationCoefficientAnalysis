DALLAS -- Oklahoma City made one of its first nine shots in the third quarter, Peja Stojakovic joined the West finals with a 3-pointer to give Dallas the lead, yet it is the Thunder who have somehow found a way to stay in front, 76-72, after three quarters as they try to stave off elimination.

Down 66-63 after the Stojakovic 3, followed by a brain-freeze technical on Russell Westbrook for shoving Jason Terry, the Thunder came back fast with a 9-0 run to lead 72-66.

Westbrook is 9-of-21 from the floor but it's hard to fault his aggression and effort. He's getting to the rim and is 7-of-7 from the free throw line. Kevin Durant has been just the opposite. He doesn't seem to be into any flow or rhythm. He was 4-of-6 from the floor in the first quarter and then missed his next five shots and had just one point until he splashed a 3-pointer that tied it at 66-66 and sparked the run.

OKC continues to have trouble scoring when it can really benefit itself. With a chance to go up by eight late in the quarter, it couldn't and Dirk Nowitzki somehow flipped in a reverse to cut the deficit to four points with 6.8 seconds to go. He is 6-of-8 for 17 points. Shawn Marion and Jason Terry each have 12.
