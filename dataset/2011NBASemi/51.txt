In the second half of Game 1, the Miami Heat did everything possible to lose.

The Heat settled for outside jumpshots, they didn't rotate to the outside shooter on defense and they played right in Chicago's hands and it's no surprise that the top-seeded Bulls blew the game wide open and took an early lead in the series.

Tonight, the Heat have another chance to steal home-court advantage and if I'm Erik Spolestra, I'm in my team's ear about how tonight is a must-win game. If you want to beat the Bulls, you have to hit them early and often and avoid letting them get on a roll.

You want to be going back to South Beach with a tied series and two games on deck in Miami. That is a lot of momentum to be dealing with, especially with the breaks between games in the NBA Playoffs.

Miami needs something to believe in after suffering its worst loss of the postseason and it's time for the Heat to play the way we saw for most of the series against the Celtics.

It's time for LeBron James and Dwyane Wade to start driving to the basket and it's time for Chris Bosh to assert himself on the defensive glass. Otherwise, this Heat team is going to be heading home a lot earlier than anyone expected.

Chicago cannot get the type of second-chance opportunities it got in the first game and if the Bulls do, they will make the Heat pay again tonight. There are a lot of adjustments to be made and if we don't see some real improvement from Miami, I would be real concerned heading back home if I'm the Heat.

Things have to change in this series and it has to start tonight. If not, the pressure is going to mount and that's a situation the Heat have always crumbled under.

Tonight is a pivotal game in this series.
