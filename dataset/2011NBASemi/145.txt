The 2011 NBA playoff schedule is now over for the conference finals. History will show that both the Heat-Bulls and Mavericks-Thunder series were very short, each ending in five games.
 Yet if it wasn't 

for some late comebacks, these battles could both still be going on right now. It appeared that Chicago would stay alive for much of Game 5, yet, just like the Thunder, Chicago couldn't prevent a massive comeback that destroyed its season.

Both of the last two playoff series have been a mirror image of each other. Therefore, it was fitting that the Heat had a massive late run to end things over the Bulls, just like the Mavericks did to finish the Thunder. Yet Miami's 18-3 run to close out an 83-80 Game 5 win, as reported by Sports Illustrated, may have been more impressive than Dallas' 17-2 run to force overtime in Game 4.

For one thing, the Heat pulled its comeback out in an elimination game, and seemed to be more overmatched than the Mavericks were before its rally. Chicago had finally clamped down on the Miami Big 3, its defense holding the Heat to 65 points in the first 45 minutes.

Miami could have afforded to lose, since it would have still held a 3-2 lead going back home, where the team hasn't lost in the playoffs. However, the Heat would not let Chicago have any new life; more specifically, LeBron James and Dwayne Wade wouldn't let it.

Although James wasn't as dominant as usual and Wade had several turnovers and some apparent shoulder problems, the two combined for the first 16 of Miami's last 18 points. This included a four-point play from Wade, a tying three-pointer from James, and a James jumper that put the Heat ahead for good.

On the other end of the court, Derrick Rose came up short in the last minutes yet again. Not only did Rose commit the foul that led to Wade's four-point play, he missed a free throw that would have tied the score at 81.
