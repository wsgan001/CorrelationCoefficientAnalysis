In Game 1 of this Western Conference finals, Westbrook shot just 3-for-15 from the field but was able to score 20 points thanks to a 14-of-18 performance from the foul line. Westbrook missed several shots near the basket as he drove into the lane.

So far this postseason, Westbrook is shooting a dismal 39.5 percent from the field.

"I don't think Westbrook will go 3-for-15 again," Kevin Durant said. "You can quote me on that. I think James Harden will give us a bigger push the next game; he played well still. Guys like Daequan [Cook], he will come out and help us out as well. I have a lot of faith in my teammates and I believe in them and no matter if they miss 10 shots in a row, I'm still going to pass them the ball, still going to have trust in them. That's what it's all about. We got to lean on each other. One guy can't win a series, two guys can't win a series. So we got to stick together."

Westbrook, one of the more athletic players in the NBA, was able to get free from the Mavs' guards along the perimeter but wasn't able to finish when he got near the basket.

When asked what types of defenses the Mavs were employing to slow him down, he said, "Nothing. I just missed shots."

Later on, Westbrook noted, "It's not about me or what I was doing. It's about our team, and we have to continue to play."
