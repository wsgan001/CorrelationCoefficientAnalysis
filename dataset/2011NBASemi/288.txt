DALLAS -- The Mavericks are headed to the NBA Finals for the second time in franchise history.

Against the young Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavs won the Western Conference finals, 4-1, clinching things with a 100-96 victory on Wednesday night.

"It's exciting, but my sense is we're very grounded," Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. "We'll enjoy this moment for a day, watch the [Miami-Chicago] game tomorrow night and see where things are. We have a lot of work left to do."

Much like in Game 4, the Mavericks had to rally to beat the Thunder.

This time, instead of a 15-point deficit, the Mavs trailed 87-79 with 8:04 to play before mounting a rally.

The Mavericks took the lead on a Dirk Nowitzki 3-pointer with 1:14 left and got clutch play from Shawn Marion, whose three-point play with a dunk and a foul with 48.9 seconds to play gave Dallas a 98-94 edge.

"Psychologically there was stuff that could have gotten us down, but our guys stayed with it," Carlisle said. "And [the Thunder's] time will come, but it's not now. We feel like now is our time to move on. This is a great moment, but we've got a lot of work left to do."

When Marion was asked where the champagne was, he said, "Four more wins."
