OKLAHOMA CITY -- The Thunder got off to the roaring start they needed, led by Kevin Durant making his first five shots. It was a hold-your-breath quarter with 11 total turnovers -- six by the Mavs -- and the Thunder shooting 57.7 percent from the field to hold a 31-22 lead.

But the Mavs can exhale on the bench for a few minutes and be decently satisfied that they're not down 15, which the Thunder were at the end of the first quarter in Game 3.

Dirk Nowitzki made his first shot on the Mavs' opening possession, but he wouldn't take his second shot attempt until the end of the quarter. Jason Terry came in firing, but all blanks, going 0-of-3.

Durant finished with 10 points. Russell Westbrook is 3-0f-7 for six points.
