Berry Tramel, a columnist for The Oklahoman, wrote Monday that Oklahoma City Thunder superstar Kevin Durant needs to be more aggressive and stand up to the Mavericks, who he called bullies.

¡§The Mavericks limited Durant's space,¡¨ he wrote. ¡§Got in his grill. Even when Durant had an occasional open look, he was off. You could tell on his first two shots his rhythm was off. Then Durant's third shot was an air-ball from 25 feet.

¡§As Durant learned against Memphis, you've got to stand up to bullies.¡¨

Tramel, who also referred to the Mavericks as the ¡§James Garners,¡¨ a witty pun referring to Garner¡¦s Maverick television character in the late 1950s, pointed out the decline in offensive production from Durant and Dirk Nowitzki during this series.

He joked that, ¡§if this trend holds, both Durant and Dirk might be deactivated if there's a Game 7.¡¨

Durant scored 40 in Game 1, 24 in Game 2 and 24 in Game 3. Nowitzki netted 48 in the series opener before posting 29 and 18 points in the last two games.
