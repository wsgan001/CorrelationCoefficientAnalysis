For the first time in five head-to-head meetings this season (regular and postseason), the Miami Heat outrebounded the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday. Not coincidentally, it・s the Heat・s first win in the five meetings, and they evened up the Eastern Conference Finals at one game apiece.

The Bulls have not been able to keep the Heat from scoring down low, allowing Miami to shoot 64.6 percent from inside 10 feet in this series. In Game 2, the Heat entered the fourth quarter shooting 20-for-27 (74.1 pct) from inside 10 feet before cooling down.


Although they can score down low, the Heat haven・t been able to shoot from farther out. They were 10-for-34 (29.4 pct) from 10 feet and out in Game 2. For the series, the Heat are 22-for-71 (31.0 pct) from at least 10 feet.

Both teams combined to shoot just 18.2 percent (6-for-33) from three-point range, with each team making three each.

Through three quarters, the Bulls dominated the offensive glass but struggled to capitalize, scoring just 16 points as they went 4-for-13 on second-chance opportunities. That came back to haunt them in the fourth, as the Heat kept Chicago off the glass, holding the Bulls to just two second-chance points on a single offensive rebound.

The Heat weren・t that much better down the stretch. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Game 2 was just the fourth playoff game in the shot-clock era (since 1954-55) in which the two teams combined to score 24 or fewer points in the fourth quarter.

In the final 4:28 of the game, Miami closed the game on a 12-2 run, with nine of those points coming from LeBron James. In that span the Bulls shot just 1-8 from the field.

James and Dwyane Wade struggled in Game 1, combining for 33 points and nine rebounds. They did much better Wednesday, combining for 53 points and 19 rebounds in the win.
