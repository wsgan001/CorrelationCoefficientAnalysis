Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Chicago Bulls and Miami Heat started with a bang, but ended with a whimper as both teams faded in the second half. Chicago got the worst of it, scoring just 10 points in the final 12 minutes and 29 points in the second half in an 85-75 loss. Even with the poor performance, Chicago still managed to stay within striking distance until a quick LeBron James scoring burst late in the fourth sealed the game and evened the series at one game apiece.

How bad was the fourth quarter for the Bulls? Chicago was just 4-16 from the field in the final frame and missed all five three-point attempts. Derrick Rose was non-existent, missing each of his shot attempts as he, like the rest of the team went cold. The only bright spot, and only player to make a field in the fourth quarter? That would be none other than Taj Gibson, who made all four of Chicago's baskets in the fourth.

Neither team set the world on fire in Game 2, but with the door wide-open, Chicago was unable to capitalize. Miami, on the other hand, did just enough to keep the Bulls at arms-length until James came in and played the role of closer. It wasn't pretty by any means, but the Heat head back to South Beach with the series even at one.
