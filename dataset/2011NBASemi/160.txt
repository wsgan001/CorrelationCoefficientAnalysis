DALLAS -- The Mavericks didn・t cause Russell Westbrook・s Game 1 shooting woes, according to the All-Star point guard.

：Nothing,； Westbrook said when asked what Dallas did to cause him to go 3-of-15 from the floor. ：I just missed shots.；

What a coincidence! That・s what happened the three times the Mavs met the Thunder during the regular season.

Westbrook shot 31.8 percent from the floor while Oklahoma City lost two of three games against the Mavs this season. His 14.6 points per game against the Mavs was his lowest against any foe. So it・s not like his 20-percent performance in the series opener can be considered a stunner.

If there is a somewhat surprising stat in Westbrook・s Game 1 line, it・s the three assists (compared to four turnovers). He averaged 8.7 dimes against Dallas this season and 8.2 overall.

But the Mavs clearly have a solid game plan when it comes to limiting Westbrook as a scorer. (He got 20 points in Game 1 because of 14-of-18 free throw shooting, but the Mavs will happily live with such an inefficient performance from the Thunder・s second-best player.) That plan begins with preventing Westbrook from getting transition buckets and the big men challenging him every time he gets in the paint.

Kevin Durant said he・d bet his house that Westbrook wouldn・t have another 3-of-15 game in the series. That might be true, but it・s a better bet that Westbrook・s struggles will continue, whether or not he wants to acknowledge Dallas・ defensive effort.
