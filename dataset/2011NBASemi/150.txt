Dwyane Wade is headed back to the NBA Finals, and this time he・s bringing his Superfriends with him.

LeBron James made sure of that with 28 points in Thursday・s pulsating 83-80 win that clinched the series for the Miami Heat at the United Center.

So did Chris Bosh on an 20-point, 10-rebound night against the revved-up Bulls, who somehow blew a 12-point lead in the final three minutes. 

：We don・t honestly know what happened,； James said. ：We know there were some big plays that happened. We know we won the game, but it went so fast.；

Wade did his part, too, shaking off a miserable nine-turnover night with 10 of his 21 points late in the fourth quarter.
