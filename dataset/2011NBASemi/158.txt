DALLAS ¡V The matchup of old man Jason Kidd defending the Thunder¡¦s lightning quick 22-year-old point guard Russell Westbrook has been analyzed in great detail.

It¡¦s probably been analyzed too much. The Mavs will carefully pick their spots to give the Westbrook assignment to Kidd, whose legs likely aren¡¦t up for chasing Westbrook around for 36 minutes per game even after more than a week of rest.

When Kidd does take his turns on Westbrook, his strategy will be simple.

¡§You¡¦ve got to just make it tough and tip your hat when he does make jump shots,¡¨ Kidd said. ¡§But you try to keep him out of the paint. It¡¦s easier said than done because he can get to the basket any time he wants.¡¨

Finishing at the basket will also be easier said than done against Dallas. Tyson Chandler plans to make sure of that.

The Mavs don¡¦t expect Kidd or DeShawn Stevenson or Jason Terry or J.J. Barea to shut down Westbrook one-on-one. They held Westbrook to 31.8 percent shooting in three regular-season meetings because of great help defense.

The biggest key is to keep Westbrook from getting out on the fast break. He has the most transition points of any player this postseason, according to ESPN Stats and Information. When Westbrook does get penetration, the Mavs want to make sure he¡¦s taking contested shots, as he did while shooting only 10-of-26 in the paint against them this season.

¡§We¡¦ve got to build a wall on him,¡¨ Chandler said. ¡§He¡¦s so great in transition. He¡¦s one of the more athletic guards in the league. It¡¦s not about one guy stopping him. It¡¦s about our team slowing him down.

¡§I¡¦m going to have to be a lot of help for our guards on penetration and getting back on defense. He goes 100 miles per hour. My job is to get back and help build that wall.¡¨
