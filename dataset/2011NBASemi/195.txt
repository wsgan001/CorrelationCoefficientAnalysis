DALLAS -- Oklahoma City pulled off the 106-100 Game 2 victory over the host Mavericks even without the help of starting point guard Russell Westbrook. After shooting 3 of 15 from the field on Tuesday, Westbrook bounced back with a 7 for 15 showing Thursday.

However, that came without seeing the floor in the final quarter.

Westbrook finished with 18 points, four assists and three rebounds in just over 28 minutes of play.

Reporters figured the 2011 All-Star would feel slighted by not playing in his team's biggest quarter of the season, but he wasn't about to say the wrong thing.

"We was winning, man," he said about watching from the sidelines during the final 12 minutes. "I know you all want to ask the same question and I'm going to tell you all the same answer: we was winning."

Thunder coach Scott Brooks was happy with what he was getting from backup point guard Eric Maynor and decided to not mess with a good thing.

"We weren't getting a lot of things done and it was his time to come out," Brooks said, "and I stayed with Eric."

"Eric was playing well," Brooks added. "It had nothing to do with Russell."

Not even a reporter's second try could get Westbrook to say something controversial.

"I'm not really worried about what I'm doing," he said, "I'm just trying to go out and win. That's what my main objective is and that's all it's about."
