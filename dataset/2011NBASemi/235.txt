OKLAHOMA CITY -- After Game 2 in the first round against Portland, Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle made a defensive adjustment with some of his guards that has stuck throughout this playoff run.

Instead of allowing the opponent to walk the ball up the floor and get into their offensive set, Carlisle implores DeShawn Stevenson, J.J. Barea and Jason Terry to pick up their man well above the time line. The additional pressure might not produce an increase in backcourt turnovers, but it exerts more energy and takes a few ticks off the shot clock before the offense can set up, and that can contribute to rushed shots or turnovers.

"Not allowing space to operate is important. You watch both series going on right now, it・s hard to breathe out there," coach Rick Carlisle said. "In certain situations and certain matchups we want pressure. There are other guys we don・t want to pressure Westbrook fullcourt because he・ll just blow by us and fly to the rim. Some of those things vary from matchup to matchup, but we・ve got to be tough and strong and we・ve got to sustain."

Westbrook is a tricky fullcourt cover because of his great speed and then power to get to the basket. It also makes sense to pressure him as early in the shot clock as possible. He averaged nearly four turnovers a game during the regular season and he's averaging 5.0 in this series and 4.6 in the playoffs. He's coming off a seven-turnover game in Game 3.

"That・s what we have to do is pressure them," said Stevenson, who has the task of guarding Westbrook as well as stints on Kevin Durant. "[It helps if] they start their offense a little later instead of coming up and seeing the whole court, especially with Westbrook, he・s so talented."
