The 2011 NBA Eastern Conference Finals are ready to begin! After a long season, and many thrilling and exciting moments on the hardwood, the final two teams in the Easter Conference are set to square off.

The Miami Heat will take on the Chicago Bulls for the right to advance to the NBA Finals.

Everyone knows the Miami Heat and what they are all about. Win it all, or the season is a failure! When your front court is Lebron James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, AND you have a celebration BEFORE the season starts, if you fall short of a championship, the season is a failure.

There are no excuses for Miami. They put the pressure on themselves. Anything short of 2-3 championships over the next five seasons with the roster they put together will be, and should be, considered a failure.

The Chicago Bulls on the other hand have nothing to lose. They are the underdog in this series and aren't picked by many experts to knock off the Heat.

Be careful, this Bulls team is good, real good! Led by NBA-MVP Derrick Rose, Chicago not only has the best record in the Eastern Conference, but they are the best team at defending their home court.

The Bulls swept the Heat this season, winning all three games in which they faced each other.
