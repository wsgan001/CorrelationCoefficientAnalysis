CHICAGO -- The Chicago Bulls lead the Miami Heat 45-38 at halftime in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals.

Luol Deng leads the Bulls with 14 points while Derrick Rose has 10. LeBron James has 11 to lead the Heat. Dwyane Wade has nine.

Tom Thibodeau stressed before the game that in order for the Bulls to get back on track and play like they had earlier in the series, they had to play better defense to get their offense moving. Through 24 minutes, that's exactly what they've done. The Heat are shooting 37 percent from the field. The Bulls have 12 fastbreak points compared to four from the Heat. Kyle Korver appears to have snapped out of his shooting skid as he already has five points off the bench. The big key for the Bulls is that they are dominating the boards like they did in Game 1. They have 23 compared to just 14 for the Heat. It will be up to Rose to take over the game late and make the shots that he missed in Game 4. The Bulls also need more from Joakim Noah and Carlos Boozer -- the pair has combined for just seven points and seven rebounds in the first 24 minutes.
