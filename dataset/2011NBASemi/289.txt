Russell Westbrook had 31 points, eight rebounds and five assists, while Kevin Durant and James Harden each scored 23 points in another tough loss to the Mavericks, eliminating OKC from the playoffs.

Once again, the Thunder's offense looked nonexistent at times, especially when Eric Maynor waved off everyone and shot an airball with a minute left and the game on the line. There were also some shaky calls, and the Mavericks played at a very high level, but Scott Brooks, who appeared to be getting instruction from both his assistants near the end of the game, is deservedly going to catch a lot of heat over how the last two series went down for the Thunder. Just too much standing around on offense, too many times.
