OKLAHOMA CITY¡X
¡X Dirk Nowitzki scored 18 points on an off night for both of the game's superstars, and the Dallas Mavericks built a huge lead early before hanging on for a 93-87 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals.

The Mavericks, who tied with Miami for the league's best road record during the regular season, won for the fourth straight time outside Dallas in these playoffs and reclaimed home-court advantage, two nights after letting it get away in Game 2 at Dallas.


Nowitzki shot seven for 21 from the field but Dallas still called on him in the clutch to hold off Oklahoma City's late charge. Nowitzki scored 10 of his points in the final 71/2 minutes.

NBA scoring champion Kevin Durant also struggled from the field, hitting only seven of 22 shots to finish with 24 points for Oklahoma City. He also had 12 rebounds, five assists, two blocked shots and two steals.

Russell Westbrook led all scorers with 30 points, but the Thunder's point guard had only four assists and was charged with seven turnovers.

Oklahoma City also was undone by poor shooting from three-point range, making only one of 17 attempts.

Shawn Marion scored 18 points for Dallas, making nine of 13 from the field, and Jason Kidd had 13 points, eight assists, six rebounds and four steals. Jason Terry scored 13 points off the bench for the Mavericks, whose reserves outscored those of Oklahoma City, 28-16.

The Thunder fell behind by 23 points in the second quarter before inching to within 16 at halftime. The Mavericks scored the first six points of the third quarter to make it 58-36, but the Thunder fought back to trail only 70-56 after three.

A driving layup by Westbrook cut Dallas' lead to single digits for the first time since midway through the opening quarter. The Thunder closed to within six before the Mavericks put the game away on a pair of foul-line jumpers from Nowitzki.
