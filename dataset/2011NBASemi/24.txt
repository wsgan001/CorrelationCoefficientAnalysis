It was all about the defense for the Chicago Bulls in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Facing the Miami Heat trio of Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Chris Bosh, the Bulls clamped down on the defensive end, taking the role players out of the game and placing the pressure squarely on the shoulders of the Big Three. And as the Heat tried to ride the Big Three to a Game 1 win, the strategy fell right into the hands of the Bulls, who turned what should've been an even matchup into a 21-point route.

James and Wade were nearly non-factors, combining to score just 33 points -- Wade had 18, James had 15. Chris Bosh led all scorers with 30 points, but the struggles of his two partners in crime were apparent, and the affect on the Heat as a whole was evident. Ball movement was minimal, role players were uninvolved and the Bulls defense was elite.

Outside of the Big Three, the rest of the eight-man rotation combined to score just 19 points. Joel Anthony took just one shot, and missed it, Mike Bibby took just four, making two, and only Mario Chalmers made a significant contribution off the bench, scoring nine points in 23 minutes. It was a nightmare start for the Heat, who came into the series riding high after knocking-off the Boston Celtics with relative ease.

Sunday was a reality-check for the Heat and a statement for the Bulls. Using strong defense and the offensive magic of Derrick Rose, Chicago got off to the perfect start, and placed itself in the driver's seat going forward.
