The Chicago Bulls vs Miami Heat of NBA Eastern Conference Finals is the biggest series the city of Chicago has seen since the Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen era. The atmosphere at the United Center is electric for sure, except the Phil Jackson-Michael Jordan tandem will be replaced with Thibodeau-Rose who have been successful all season against the Heat.

With the Big Three James,Wade And Bosh of Miami, the Heat have averaged 102.1 points per game this season. What interesting is the Bulls held Miami Heat to 96, 89 and 86 points, respectively in the regular season and win all three of those games. So Thibodeau defense should be the key for the Bulls to win.

But this is Eastern Conference Finals and the Miami Heat are dominant in the East Playoff by choking the Sixers and the mighty Celtics all in five games. Wade averaged 30.2 points in the Boston series. Lebron James scored 35 and 33 in the final two games against the Celtics.

Interesting key matchup would be Luol Deng vs. Lebron James. The Bulls stingy defense on James would be attributed to Deng, but nobody can stop Lebron James if he plays the way he did in the final two games against the Celtics, when he averaged 34 points.

When the outside shooting of Miami Heat will click plus the treat always of Wade and James driving the lane would be too much for the Bulls who always rely on their ace Derrick Rose.
