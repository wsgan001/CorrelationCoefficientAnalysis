Dirk Nowitzki started off slowly, but finished with 40 points on 12-of-20 shooting (2-of-3 from deep, 14-of-15 from the foul line) with five rebounds and three assists as the Mavs outclassed the Thunder in Monday's Game 4 win, despite the Thunder having everything go their way for about three quarters.

The Mavs were uncharacteristically impatient to start the game and failed to get Dirk involved early, with most of their 13 turnovers coming in the first half. Once the Thunder's easy opportunities dried up and Dallas was able to capitalize on their non-existent offensive strategy, the Mavs' steady dose of aggression and execution took hold in the fourth quarter -- culminating in a 15-point comeback with five minutes to play. Jason Kidd's go-ahead trey with 40 seconds left sealed the win in overtime, and Jason Terry scored 20 points on 7-of-19 shooting, as the Mavs take a 3-1 lead to Dallas and look poised for a trip to the Finals.
