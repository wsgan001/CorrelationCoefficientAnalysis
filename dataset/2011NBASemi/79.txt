The Heat came back from a heavy Game 1 defeat to win 85-75 on Wednesday night, a victory that means they will reach the NBA Finals if they win all of their games at the American Airlines Arena.

The Bulls have been in this position before, though, having rallied from 1-1 after two home games to beat the Atlanta Hawks in the Conference semi-finals, and Gibson is confident they have what it takes to do it again.

：We・ve got a lot of confidence. We・ve been in this situation before, but this is the playoffs now and that・s a tough team,； Gibson said. ：But we・re not shying away from anything. We understand that it・s going to be a hostile environment, but we・re up to the challenge.

：Like Thibs (Bulls head coach Tom Thibodeau) says, ．We・re going to walk through the fire,・ and right now, we・re walking through it and we・re going through it as a team.；

The Heat・s Game 2 win was built around a more physical defensive approach, which helped them turn the tables on the Bulls and beat them at their own game, rebounding.

Central to that effort was the returning forward Udonis Haslem, the co-captain pulling in five boards and 13 points from 23 minutes off the bench.

：He played very well,； Bulls centre Joakim Noah said. ：You・ve got to give credit where credit is due. The guy didn・t play all year, and for him to come out and play the way he did... I have a lot of respect for that player.；

Haslem was considered a risk for the game having missed 69 regular season games before playing just seven minutes of the Heat・s post-season. But the forward is confident he can step up again, if required on Sunday.

：I don・t see why I can・t,； he said. ：I・m going to get out there and lay it on the line.

：It・s never about shots for me; it・s all about rebounding and defence.；
