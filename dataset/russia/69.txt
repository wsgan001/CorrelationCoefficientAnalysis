Election observers: Russian presidential poll skewed towards Vladimir Putin

Election observers said Mr Putin, who officially won about 64 percent of the vote, was given a clear advantage over his rivals in the media and that state resources were used at a regional level to support his bid for a third presidential term.

"The conditions for the campaign were clearly skewed in favour of one candidate. Also, overly restrictive candidate registration requirements limited genuine competition. While all candidates had access to media, only one candidate - the current prime minister - was given clear advantage in the coverage," Tiny Kox, head of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) said at a news conference in central Moscow.

"The biggest problem with this election is that there was no real competition ... The broadcast media was clearly biased in favour of one candidate and did not provide fair coverage of the other candidates," Tonino Picula, the head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Parliamentary Association added.

Mr Putin's opponents have refused to recognise the result of the election, which could allow the former KGB spy to rule Russia for as long as Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.

He has already served as president or premier for 12 consecutive years and made way for his ally, Dmitry Medvedev, in 2008 only because of constitutional limits.
