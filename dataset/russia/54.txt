Presidential candidate and Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said on Sunday he was voting for an ¡§educated and prosperous¡¨ Russia as he cast his ballot in the presidential elections.

¡§I personally voted for a Russia that is educated, healthy, intelligent and prosperous. I want Russian citizens to feel they are people and not serfs. I am confident that a good future lies ahead of Russia,¡¨ Zyuganov said after he voted at a polling station in Moscow.

Zyuganov said, however, that the Communists had already started to register some election violations.

He also said a higher turnout at the elections would ensure stricter control over the results, which would increase the probability of a second round vote.

Last December¡¦s parliamentary elections in Russia triggered mass protests over alleged vote fraud in favor of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's ruling United Russia party.

The Communist leader said street protests would be held on Monday after the presidential elections.

¡§There will be a lot of street actions and requests to hold rallies have already been submitted, but I am calling on everyone to show restraint and comply with the law,¡¨ he said.
