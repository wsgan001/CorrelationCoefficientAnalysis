Attempt to kill Russia's Putin foiled: security agencies

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Security services in Russia and Ukraine said on Monday they had foiled a plot to kill Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, but his opponents ridiculed the announcement as a campaign stunt six days before he runs in Russia's presidential election.

Russia's pro-government Channel One television said two men arrested belonged to a group seeking an Islamist state in Russia's North Caucasus. A computer seized contained numerous video files showing Putin's motorcade moving about Moscow, said the report.

"Our final goal was to go to Moscow and attempt to assassinate Putin," a bruised man described as one of the plotters was shown saying in a police interview transmitted on Channel One.

"Our deadline was after the election of the president of Russia," said the man, who was named as Adam Osmayev. "There are combat mines which are called armor-piercing mines. So it wouldn't necessarily have to be a suicide bomber."

Opinion polls show Putin will win the election and reclaim the post he held from 2000 to 2008. But he faces a growing opposition protest movement and wants to secure outright victory on Sunday, averting a runoff that might dent his authority.

A spokeswoman for Ukraine's security agency SBU said a man was detained in the Black Sea port of Odessa on January 4 after an explosion at an apartment that killed an accomplice. Another suspect, on the international wanted list, fled, she said.

"We found him in an apartment and detained him without a single shot being fired on February 4," SBU spokeswoman Marina Ostapenko said.

"I can officially confirm that they were preparing an (assassination) attempt on Putin."
