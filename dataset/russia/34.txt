Has there been a fraud during Russian Elections?

The presidential election in Russia came to an end but now some of the monitors report that there were serious problems that they observed during the vote over this weekend and that they feel that there maybe some electoral violations. That found response among the protesters who are now planning to organize another rally against Vladimir Putin, who won the election. We will discuss this and other related issues with Vyacheslav Tetyokin, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and a Member of Parliament, and Sergey Markov, the Putin Representative for the March 4th election.
