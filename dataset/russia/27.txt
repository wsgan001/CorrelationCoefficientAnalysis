Communist Kremlin hopeful looks to a new generation

NOVOMOSKOVSK, Russia (Reuters) - A flashy campaign advertisement sets the scene after Russia's presidential election: Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov steps out of a black Mercedes in front of the Kremlin, the seat of power since Soviet times.

After three failed attempts to win the presidency, the perennial loser of Russian politics is trying to convince the country once again to vote him into the top office in Sunday's election.

Addressing the frustration of many Russians who feel powerless to end Vladimir Putin's dominance, a voiceover in the advertisement asks: "No choice?"

"There is always a choice," it says, flashing to footage of the stern-faced Communist leader.

Zyuganov has fed off of the largest protests Putin has faced in his 12-year rule, seeking support from young voters who do not remember the Soviet Union or his past failures and simply refuse to vote for Putin's third term in office.

He says he is injecting new life into the ranks of a party which until recently has evoked images of poor pensioners nostalgic for the days of Soviet glory, waving red flags and clutching portraits of Stalin.

"We have the youngest, strongest and most dynamic team in the whole country," Zyuganov told a packed hall at a university in the small western city of Novomoskovsk, on St. Tatiana's Day, celebrated as student's day in Russia.

"And the youth stand behind us," said the 67-year-old former physics and mathematics teacher.
