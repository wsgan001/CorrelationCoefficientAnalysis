Russia¡¦s elections win foreign praise

A number of international observers have praised Russia¡¦s elections for fairness and openness which they say are yet to be emulated by countries in Europe.

There have been statements to this effect from Euro-parliament member Johan Ewald Stadler, Italian politician Alessandro Mussolini and Slovakian delegate to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Sergei Chelemendik.

Mr Mussolini mentioned what he described as a top-notch video monitoring system deployed at the polling stations. Mr Chelemendik said Russia is a dynamic civilization evolving in the direction of modern democracy.
