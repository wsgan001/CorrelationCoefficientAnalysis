Gorbachev doubts results of Russian presidential poll

(AGI) Moscow - Mikhail Gorbachev doubts that the outcome of the presidential election in Russia reflects the will of the people. Gorbachev said the results of the presidential election, which suggest that Vladimir Putin won in the first round, "do not reflect the will of the people". The last USSR leader went on to say that "if there is no documented evidence of mass vote fraud, it is difficult to say that it happened".
