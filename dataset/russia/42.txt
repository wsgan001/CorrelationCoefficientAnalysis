Putin claims victory in Russia's presidential election

Vladimir Putin has claimed victory in Russia's presidential election, which opposition and independent observers say was marred by widespread violations.

Putin made the claim at a rally of tens of thousands of his supporters outside the Kremlin, thanking his supporters for helping foil foreign plots aimed to weaken the country.

Putin tallied 58-59% of Sunday's vote, according to exit polls cited by state television.

Monitored by web cameras and a network of volunteer civilian observers, Russians voted Sunday in presidential elections expected to return Vladimir Putin to the Kremlin.

By midday in Moscow, the independent elections watchdog group had recorded more than 1,000 complaints of irregularities across the country.

The complaints ranged from questionable voter registration lists to non-functioning web cameras to buses believed to be carrying so-called "carousel voters" from precinct to precinct.

"There have been many people voting more than once, driven around in buses in large numbers" in Moscow, said Golos head Lilia Shibanova, who said similar reports had been received from Novosibirsk, Russia's third-largest city, and the city of Barnaul in southern Siberia.

The large number of complaints is likely to bolster opposition supporters' suspicion that the election was unfair.

Allegations of widespread vote fraud in last December's parliamentary elections set off an unprecedented wave of massive protests against Putin.

The protests, the largest public show of anger in post-Soviet Russia, demonstrated the county's growing frustration with corruption and political ossification in Putin's Russia.
