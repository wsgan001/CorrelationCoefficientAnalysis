¡§It just feels like Oklahoma City senses it,¡¨ Kerr said early in the fourth quarter after the Thunder had built a 10-point lead. ¡§They are ready to break through. It's like a changing of the guard right before our eyes.¡¨

Said TNT analyst Reggie Miller, ¡§We've seen a team grow up in front of our eyes and mature.¡¨

The Thunder had to withstand a furious rally by the Spurs but pulled out the victory aided by James Harden's miraculous 3-point shot that Kerr called ¡§maybe the shot of the year for Oklahoma City.¡¨ Harden drained a 3-pointer to give the Thunder a 106-101 just before the shot clock expired.

¡§A little shimmy, a pullup jumper for a three and Harden just sucked the life out of the whole building,¡¨ Kerr said.

On the postgame show, Shaquille O'Neal said he is expecting a louder than normal Chesapeake Energy Arena on Wednesday night when the Thunder can clinch a berth in the NBA Finals for the first time. ¡§I'm going to steal a quote from Chuck, Wednesday in Oklahoma City that place is going to be rocking.¡¨
