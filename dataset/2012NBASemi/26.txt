Miami Heat forward Chris Bosh, out indefinitely with a lower abdominal strain since Game 1 of the second-round series with the Indiana Pacers, will travel to Boston with the team but will not play in Games 3 and 4 against the Celtics, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said Thursday before the team hit the road.

Asked how close Bosh is to returning, Spoelstra said, "It's too early to tell right now. I think we're all encouraged that he's actually able to do some work."

Bosh continued his potential return this season with an on-court workout Wednesday that Spolestra said was more rebab-oriented than basketball-related. Rey Jaffett, the Heat's assistant trainer/director of rehabilitation, and assistant coach Keith Askins led the workout.

Bosh will continue rehab, although Spoelstra refuses to put a timeline on his return.

Spoelstra watched Wednesday's workout but said, "I didn't need to have to watch it. It hasn't got to that point. I just wanted to show him some support and see how much he's progressing. It's the same thing as before. It's more rehab-oriented.

Bosh was injured late in the first quarter of the series-opener against the Pacers in the Eastern Conference semifinals. He rejoined the bench for Game 1 against the Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals but has not been in uniform.

"We want him around so we can work with him, work with Rey and work with Keith," Spoelstra said. "He's done three straight workouts. He just finished one again. The same workout. A little bit different, but it's a rehab/basketball workout."
