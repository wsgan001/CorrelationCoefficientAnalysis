All 10 Spurs who played scored points, as Kawhi Leonard added 16 points and forward Tim Duncan had 11 points and 12 rebounds. The Spurs made 55.1 percent of their field goals (43 of 78), and hit a scoring high for this postseason.

Notes: Duncan's four blocks gave him 473 career blocked shots in the postseason, passing Hakeem Olajuwon (472) for second all-time. Duncan needs four more blocks to pass postseason blocks leader Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (476).....Oklahoma City has a 15-4 record in games played after a loss. The Thunder's last losing streak was a three-game slide against Memphis, Miami and Indiana from April 2-6... San Antonio came back from a nine-point deficit entering the fourth quarter in Game 1, pushed by a speech from coach Gregg Popovich when he told players, "I want some nasty." The phrase has become a rallying cry in San Antonio, with local retail stores printing shirts with the quote. One sign from a fan in the AT&T read "Yo quiero nasty."
