Now, it・s Heat・s turn to make series adjustments

Presented with the challenge of trying to limit either LeBron James or Dwyane Wade in Game 3, Celtics [team stats] coach Doc Rivers chose the latter. It made all the difference.

The Heat・s second-round series against the Indiana Pacers turned on Wade・s offensive resurgence. One round later, Wade・s scoring is again the focal point of a tight series. He averaged more than 22 points while attempting 17 free throws in the Heat・s Game 1 and Game 2 victories against the Celtics. On Friday, Wade was limited to 18 points on 9-of-20 shooting and he never went to the foul line.
