The Oklahoma City Thunder moved one win away from the NBA championship finals after a 108-103 road victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Monday gave them a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series.

Kevin Durant top scored for the Thunder with 27 points while Russell Westbrook provided a further 23 and James Harden 20 as Oklahoma City resigned the Spurs to a third consecutive defeat for the first time this season.

San Antonio won the opening two games of the series, part of a 20-game winning streak, but are now staring down the barrel at extinction having lost at home for the first time since April 11.

The Thunder led at each break and by as many as 14 during the second quarter before the Spurs clawed back.

Seemingly beaten when down by 13 late in the fourth, San Antonio plundered 11 unanswered points to draw within two only to see Westbrook snap the streak with a clutch basket.

Harden then sucked the life out the Spurs with a great three pointer with just 28 seconds left.

Spurs coach Gregg Popovich tried to spark his offence by starting regular sixth-man Manu Ginobili for Danny Green, but despite a game high 34 points it wasn't enough.

The series continues in Oklahoma City with Game Six on Wednesday.
