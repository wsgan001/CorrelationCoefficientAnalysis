Big tease, but still no Chris Bosh for Miami Heat

BOSTON ¡V The Miami Heat will not rush forward Chris Bosh back from a lower abdominal strain, no matter their situation against the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals.

Celtics center Kevin Garnett had his way offensively in Game 3 against the Heat, but Bosh is not ready to return and help, based on answers from Heat coach Erik Spoelstra.

"I'm not even thinking about Chris today. He's not on my mind," Spoelstra said Saturday. "'I love you, Chris, but I'm focused on (Game 4 on Sunday).' That's all my energies are focused on right now.

"I know I don't have to watch a workout of his today. If it ever gets to that point, I'll start to let my mind go there. But it's not at that time."

Translation: Bosh has not progressed and healed to the point where Spoelstra thinks it's necessary to observe how he is moving on the court and help determine when Bosh will play again.

That could change in two days or three days or even in a week. Bosh traveled with the team to Boston, but Spoelstra made clear it was so that Bosh could continue his rehab with Rey Jaffet, Miami's assistant athletic trainer and director of rehabilitation, and Heat assistant coach Keith Askins.

Bosh participated in Miami's walk-through before Friday's Game 3 and played the role of Garnett. The Heat could certainly use Bosh's size and defense against the Celtics. Garnett had 24 points and 11 rebounds, and Miami had trouble guarding him near the basket, especially on pick-and-rolls.
