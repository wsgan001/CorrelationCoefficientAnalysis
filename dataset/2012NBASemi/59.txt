Spoelstra won't rule out Bosh in Game 4

BOSTON (AP) Chris Bosh took part in the Miami Heat's morning workout Friday, though coach Erik Spoelstra won't say if the injured All-Star forward can return for Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Boston Celtics.

Bosh remained sidelined by a lower abdominal strain for Friday night's Game 3 and Spoelstra says ''his return is indefinite.'' Game 4 is Sunday in Boston.

Spoelstra says Bosh will be re-evaluated daily.

Bosh was hurt in Game 1 of the second round against Indiana, but the Heat have recovered from his absence behind a string of dominant performances from LeBron James and Dwyane Wade.

The Heat had backup center Dexter Pittman available again after he was suspended three games for elbowing Indiana's Lance Stephenson late in Game 5 of the Heat's six-game victory.
