A Big Lineup: So much for the demise of the Thunder¡¦s big lineup. Scotty Brooks used a small lineup the majority of the game, but the big lineup was particularly effective. In 19 minutes and nine seconds with a big lineup, the Thunder outscored the Spurs 45-30.

A Defensive adjustments: Putting Thabo Sefolosha on Tony Parker proved to be a masterful stroke. The Spurs¡¦ pick-and-roll was a shadow of what we saw in San Antonio. Thabo had four steals in the first three minutes, and though Parker ended up as the productive Spur (16 points, 6-of-12 shooting), some of that came with Derek Fisher or Russell Westbrook on the assignment. Through three quarters, the Spurs had 17 turnovers and 21 baskets.

A Hands: Has the Thunder ever had more active hands? Fourteen steals, nine blocked shots, maybe 10 more deflections that didn¡¦t result in turnovers. The backcourt tandem of Thabo and Russell Westbrook combined for 10 steals and three blocked shots.

D Defending Blair: Maybe the only downside to the night was the resurrection of the Spurs¡¦ DeJuan Blair, who had 22 points and 11 rebounds in a game against OKC in March. Blair, who started 62 games this season, has fallen out of the rotation and didn¡¦t even play in the series¡¦ first two games. Inserted in Game 3 garbage time, Blair had 10 points and six rebounds in less than 10 minutes. Will Gregg Popovich use him in Game 4?

A Defending Duncan: Kendrick Perkins proved that consistently frustrating Tim Duncan wasn¡¦t coming at the expense of letting Tony Parker and/or Manu Ginobili run free. While the Thunder finally clamped down on Parker and Ginobili, the shutdown of Duncan continued ¡X he made just five of 15 shots and tied a career playoff low with only two rebounds. Duncan in three games has just 38 points total and made just 13 of 48 shots.
