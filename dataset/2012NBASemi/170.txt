As we all know, Thabo¡¦s one of the best defenders in the game. We¡¦ve had him on point guards before, not a lot, but I thought he did a great job of really staying active, pursuing. I thought Thabo did a good job, but I thought the biggest adjustment was we played better.

How much did the big guys, particularly Kendrick Perkins and Serge Ibaka, take it personally make sure Parker didn¡¦t beat them when they switched onto him?

Our bigs did a good job. Serge, Perk, Nick ... they did a good job. But they way we defend, all five guys have to be participating, and we had that tonight. We had it on just about every possession. (Friday) over film, I¡¦ll be shocked if there are possessions we didn¡¦t play hard.

You said that your guys played better basketball tonight. Did they play nastier basketball, too?

I give Thabo, Russell ... I mean, Russell had an amazing game. Just look at his line ¡X 10 points, almost 10 assists, rebounds, running the floor, playing the game, defending his man. And Perk, he didn¡¦t play well last game. The decision was not to not play him; the guy has won so many games for us. I just needed him to play better. He stepped up and played better tonight. I¡¦m proud of him and all our guys.
