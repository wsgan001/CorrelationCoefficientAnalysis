Oil prices jump after OPEC fails to increase production quotas

Motorists could face higher costs at the gas pump, analysts said, as oil prices jumped after a meeting of OPEC ministers dissolved into bickering.

Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which pumps 40% of the world's oil, unexpectedly failed to agree Wednesday on plans to increase production quotas to meet growing global demand.

Ali Ibrahim Naimi, oil minister for Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, called it "one of our worst meetings ever," marked by so much discord that the cartel couldn't even agree on when to meet again.

U.S. light crude, which had been trading as low as $98.02 a barrel Wednesday, surged in response to the OPEC development and an Energy Department report that U.S. crude inventories had declined more than expected. Oil closed at $100.74 a barrel, up $1.65, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. London benchmark Brent crude climbed $1.07 to $117.85 a barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange.

Amy Myers Jaffe, senior energy analyst at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, warned that rising demand could push U.S. oil futures to between $110 and $120 a barrel. That would equate to pump prices of $3.93 to $4.25 a gallon across the U.S., just as gasoline prices seemed to be headed for a sustained decline.

"We can expect gasoline prices to creep up if it stays in this range," Jaffe said.

The average price of a gallon of gasoline in California was $3.97 on Wednesday, down sharply from $4.264 a month earlier. Nationally, the average reached $3.748 a gallon, down from $3.960 a month earlier.

Saudi Arabia, backed by Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, had begun the OPEC meeting in Vienna hoping to persuade the group to enforce its first official production increase since September 2007. The Saudi contingent believed that current prices were weighing on global demand and the economic recovery.

On May 2, crude reached as high as $114.83 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest intraday price since September 2008. In London, Brent crude peaked April 11 at $127.02 a barrel, the most since August 2008.

Although prices have slipped since then, demand has been rising. The Energy Department said in a recent report that it expected global consumption to increase by 1.7 million barrels a day this year from 2010 consumption of about 86.7 million barrels a day.
