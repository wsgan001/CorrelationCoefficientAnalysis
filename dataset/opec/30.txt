Oil prices rise after OPEC holds output steady

NEW YORK: Oil prices rallied on Wednesday after OPEC decided to leave output unchanged, dashing speculation the cartel would raise production to rein in high prices that are weighing global on economic growth.

New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in July, closed at $100.74 a barrel, a rise of $1.65 from Tuesday.

In London, Brent North Sea crude for July climbed $1.07 to settle at $117.85 a barrel.

The 12-nation Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced after a meeting in Vienna that it would maintain its official output target at 24.84 million barrels per day (bpd), where it has stood since January 2009.

The New York futures contract, which had fallen in opening trade, shot up on the announcement.

"The market was expecting an increase of the production quota figures or an actual increase on production and what we got was no action on either front," said Andy Lipow at Lipow Oil Associates.

"It appears that there is a bit of acrimony within the OPEC member countries because they were not able to agree on production levels going forward," he added.

Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said it was "one of the worst meetings" ever staged by OPEC because member nations were divided.

"The failure to agree on increases in either quotas or output risks leaving the global oil market dangerously short of crude during the period of strengthening seasonal demand over the coming half-year," said Nic Brown at Natixis.
