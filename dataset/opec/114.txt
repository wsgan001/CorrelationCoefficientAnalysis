June 6 (Bloomberg) -- Libya's representative at this week's OPEC meeting will be Omran Abu Kraa, a former minister of electricity, according to two people with knowledge of the decision.

Abu Kraa is due to arrive tomorrow in Vienna and will represent Muammar Qaddafi's government, the people said, declining to be identified before an official announcement. Shokri Ghanem, the nation's former representative, defected to join the rebels fighting to overthrow Qaddafi, according to a June 1 statement from Libya's Transitional National Council.

Hostilities in the North African country have blocked 1.4 million barrels a day of oil production. An OPEC delegate said on June 2 that producers need to boost supply by at least 500,000 barrels a day to meet demand. While Qaddafi is trying to quash a rebellion in a country holding Africa's largest crude reserves, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are backing the insurgents.

OPEC, responsible for 40 percent of global oil supplies, needs to discuss the situation in Libya, Venezuela's Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez, said as he arrived for the meeting.

Rebels control most of eastern Libya, while Qaddafi remains in power in Tripoli, the capital. Libyan rebels are "still discussing" whether to send a representative to the OPEC meeting, Jalal el-Gallal, a spokesman for the rebels' National Transitional Council, said today by phone from Benghazi, Libya.
