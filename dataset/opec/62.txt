Libya OPEC envoy says oil output minimal

VIENNA, June 8 (Reuters) - Libya's new envoy to OPEC said on Wednesday the territory under Muammar Gaddafi's government control was producing minimal amounts of crude, enough only to partly feed the country's refineries.

"There are a lot of difficulties that we are facing for the production of oil. First of all the foreign manpower has left the country and that makes the situation more complicated for producing oil," Omran Abukraa told reporters.

Abukraa, who was appointed after top oil official Shokri Ghanem defected [ID:nLDE75031M], was speaking to reporters in Vienna on the sidelines of an OPEC meeting, which failed to decide on a production quota increase. [ID:nLDE75704C]

"Secondly, nobody is interested in buying Libyan oil. That's the problem - how we produce oil and how we don't sell it," he said referring to international sanctions against Libya.

He would not give figures of current production but added Libya had still some refineries running.

"But the production of benzene, or gas oil, is not sufficient for our domestic consumption," he said.
