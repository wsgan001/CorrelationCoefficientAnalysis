OPEC Refuses Oil Production Increase After Contentious Meeting


OPEC has decided to keep its production output unchanged, defying market expectations for a production increase, which is driving up oil prices suddenly.

Nymex crude is now up nearly 2%, back above $100 a barrel, and Brent crude is up to $118. Both were down ahead of the OPEC news.

A meeting of oil ministers in Vienna broke up unexpectedly without an agreement to raise production. OPEC・s president said some members wanted three months to consider the issue.

Algeria, Angola, Venezuela, Iraq, Iran and Libya refused to consider a production increase, Saudi oil minister Ali Naimi told Dow Jones Newswires. Saudi Arabia already plans to increase production, according to reports yesterday, and it・s possible other OPEC members didn・t feel the need to join them.

：This is one of the worst meetings we ever had in OPEC,； Saudi oil minister Ali Naimi told reporters after the meeting. ：We were not able to reach an agreement.；

This could be an echo of the age of dissent and revolutions throughout the Middle East, currency analyst Ashraf Laidi said on Twitter.

OPEC・s Secretary General said there is no oil coming out of Libya right now, crimping supplies and helping keep oil prices high.

The next OPEC meeting is scheduled for December.

Adding to the weirdness, Iran・s oil minister says Iran might call for an ：extraordinary； OPEC meeting at some point.
