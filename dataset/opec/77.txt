High oil prices on agenda at crucial Opec meeting

The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries or Opec meet in Vienna, against a backdrop of record oil prices.

Demand for oil from booming Asian economies combined with political unrest in many oil producing countries have kept oil prices well over $100 a barrel for months.

While prices have cooled in recent weeks, for many observers they are still too high, and the pressure is on Opec members to increase production.

The BBC's Rico Hizon asked Jonathan Barratt of Commodity Broking in Australia if he expected OPEC to raise output.
