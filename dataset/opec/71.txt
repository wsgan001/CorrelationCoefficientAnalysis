Gasoline, Heating Oil Rise as OPEC Can・t Reach Output Decision

Gasoline and heating oil rose after OPEC ministers couldn・t reach a decision on production quotas at their meeting in Vienna today, according to the group・s secretary-general, Abdalla el-Badri.

Futures followed crude oil higher after Badri said ministers didn・t reach a consensus. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was poised to boost output for the first time since 2007.

：The OPEC meeting just broke up with no consensus on production levels and the market was anticipating they would increase production,； said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.

Gasoline for July delivery rose 1.77 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $3.0096 a gallon at 10:04 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices fell as low as $2.9623 earlier before jumping to $3.0265 after the OPEC announcement.

OPEC accounts for 40 percent of the world・s oil supply. The production limit has been unchanged since December 2008, when it was capped at 24.845 million barrels a day for all members except Iraq.

：It looked as if some people were betting on a million- and-a-half barrel hike coming through,； said Gene McGillian, an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. ：Meanwhile, the economy is still kind of sputtering. And there・s plenty of supplies.；
