Greece to present new austerity package today

FXstreet.com (Barcelona) - The Greece government, still in despair trying to find new ways to cut public spending, will present a new austerity proposal to parliament on Monday. 

In the proposal, it will be key to win enough acceptance if the country is to comply with the Troika requirements and not put at risk a still 'doubtful' next aid tranche worth over EUR 31.5 billion. 

The country faces a new week with tensions in the street escalating fast, with plans of strikes and protests. A 2-day strike against the next austerity bill is expected on Tuesday, with marches through Athens' city centre taking place. 

Greek parliament will be voting on an austerity package mounting 13.5 billion euros, mainly aimed at tax hikes and more flexibility for firms to enroll people on temporary labour contracts and make them redundant. 

"These will be the last cuts in wages and pensions," Samaras said on Sunday, cited by Reuters. "We promised to avert the country's exit from the euro and this is what we are doing. We have given absolute priority to this because if we do not achieve this everything else will be meaningless" Samaras added. 

As Richard Lee, FXstreet contributor, notes: "A dead vote on the austerity measure would place significant pressure on the single currency, as a delay of disbursement by the EU's Troika could technically place Greece in a sovereign default. Greek benchmark 10-year bonds are reflective of the sentiment, with the yield rising a little over 40 basis point to 18.18% in the last two days."
