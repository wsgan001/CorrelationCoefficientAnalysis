Hollande reportedly wins first round of French presidential race

PanARMENIAN.Net - French Socialist Francois Hollande has won most votes in the first round of the country's presidential election, estimates show.

According to BBC News, they suggest he got more than 28% of votes against about 26% for center-right incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy.

The two men will face each other in a second round on May 6.

Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen came third with about 19% of the vote, ahead of seven other candidates. The poll has been dominated by economic concerns.

Estimates based on votes counted in polling stations that closed early were announced by French media when all voting ended at 20:00.

Afterwards, Mr Hollande said he was "best placed to become the next president of the republic" and that Mr Sarkozy had been punished by voters.

It is the first time a French president running for re-election has failed to win the first round since the start of the Fifth Republic in 1958.

Sarkozy - who has been in power since 2007 - said he understood "the anguish felt by the French" in a "fast-moving world". He called for three debates during the two weeks to the second round - centring on the economy, social issues, and international relations.

Hollande promptly rejected the idea. He told reporters that the traditional single debate ahead of the second round was sufficient, and that it should "last as long as necessary".

Turnout on Sunday was high, at more than 80%.
