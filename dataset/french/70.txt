French citizen cast votes in India

Nearly 6,000 French citizens in India are casting their votes today in the first round of France presidential elections in Pondicherry, which sees incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy up against Socialist candidate Francois Hollande amongst other candidates. Voters queued up to cast their franchise as polls began in the city in the morning. In all, ten are in the race of presidential election, including Sarkozy who is suffering from very low popularity ratings due to frustration over his handling of domestic issues in France.
