Campaigns on hold as France prepares to vote

PARIS (AFP) - French presidential candidates marked a one day truce Saturday on the eve of voting in a first-round poll to whittle the ten-strong field down to two frontrunners.

French election rules outlaw both campaigning and opinion polling on the last day of the race, but Socialist challenger Francois Hollande went into the weekend favourite to oust right-wing incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy.

The two 57-year-old political veterans are expected to win the two spots in the May 6 run-off, and polls suggest that the left-winger will comfortably win the battle to become one of the most powerful leaders in the world.

France is a nuclear-armed power, a permanent member of the United Nations (UN) Security Council and the tenth biggest economy in the world in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). Its executive president wields extraordinary personal power.
