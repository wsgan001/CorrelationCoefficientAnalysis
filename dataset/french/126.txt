French presidential election turnout lower than 2007 midday Sunday

Turnout in the first round of France's presidential election was 28.29 per cent at midday, slightly lower than the 31.21 per cent in the first round of 2007's poll, which saw President Nicolas Sarkozy elected. 

Turnout for the whole day in 2007 was 83.77 per cent.

In 2002 the abstention rate was much higher, with 21 per cent at midday and 71.6 per cent for the whole day. The poor turnout resulted in Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin being eliminated and right-wing incumbent Jacques Chirac facing Front National Jean-Marie Le Pen.

Abstention rates have varied from 15 to 30 per cent in presidential elections since 1965.

This year's Socialist candidate, Francois Hollande, voted in the south-western city of Tulle on Sunday morning, while Sarkozy voted in the plush 16th arrondissement of Paris. 

Sarkozy faces nine challengers.

Voting ends at 6pm.

French law forbids the publication of exit polls or a result before 8pm. The law has stirred up a row as to whether it is practical in the internet era. 

Sarkozy was criticised by some of his rivals when he said he would not be shocked if someone gave the result before the deadline.

The authorities have threatened to sue any media that break the embargo, including Belgian and Swiss broadcasters.
