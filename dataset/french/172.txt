Poll result a 'crushing blow' for Sarkozy

The head of the School of Social and Political Studies at the University of Sydney, Professor Simon Tormey, joins The World Today to look closer at the French presidential election. He says President Nicholas Sarkozy's second-place standing in the first round is a setback for those who think he was the leader destined to transform France. Professor Tormey expects the incumbent President won't be re-elected in the final ballot, and the socialist candidate Francois Hollande will be France's next leader.
