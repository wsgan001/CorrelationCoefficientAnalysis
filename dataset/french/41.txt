French presidential candidate Hollande calls on ECB to support growth


PARIS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Francois Hollande, a frontrunner in opinion polls for the upcoming French presidential elections, on Friday called on the European Central Bank (ECB) to do more to support economic growth in the eurozone.

The Socialist candidate told local radio Europe 1 that he supported lower interest rates as a way to promote growth, adding he was also in favor of allowing the ECB to lend directly to eurozone member states.

The ECB is currently banned from directly purchasing government debt, and instead focuses on maintaining price stability and curbing inflation.

In December, it decided to offer three-year loans to banks to prevent a credit crunch, which experts said could harm the real economy. Over 1 trillion euros has been lent to banks in two financing operations in December and February.

Hollande has pledged to reorientate the ECB's role in the direction of promoting growth, vowing to renegotiate the newly-inked fiscal pact signed by 25 European countries to focus more on growth.

As the election draws closer, the role of the ECB has become a focal point in the candidates' campaigns.

President Nicolas Sarkozy declared over the weekend that he wanted the ECB to do more to promote economic growth, breaching a red line drawn by his close ally German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

On Sunday, 44.3 million registered French voters are expected to cast their ballot in the first round of presidential elections.

Polls predict Hollande will win 26 to 29 percent of the vote in the first round, followed by Sarkozy with 24 to 28 percent. In the May runoff, however, Hollande is projected to win 56 percent of the vote, and Sarkozy 44 percent, according to a survey published on Thursday by pollster LH2.
