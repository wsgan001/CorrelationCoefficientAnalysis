Nicolas Sarkozy beaten in first round of French presidential elections 

NICOLAS Sarkozy was beaten in the first round of the French presidential election yesterday.

His Socialist rival, Francois Hollande, topped the poll with about 28 per cent of the vote, early estimates showed.

Sarkozy had won about 26 per cent of the vote.

The two men will now face each other in a second round of voting on May 6.

There was a huge turn-out across France for the hotly contested first round, which also saw a strong challenge from far-right leader Marine Le Pen. She got about 20 per cent of the vote.

If Sarkozy loses the run-off, he will become the first French president not to win a second term since 1981.

The centre-right politician recently toned down his flashy image and his glamorous wife, Carla Bruni, has kept out of the spotlight.
