Hollande 'Wins' First Round of French Presidential Race Next Month

French Socialist Francois Hollande has won most votes in the first round of the country's presidential election.
Figures released by France's Interior Ministry after final polls closed on Sunday local time, show that Hollande had about 28 percent of ballots cast and center-right incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy roughly 26 percent.
The two men will now face each other in a second round on May 6th.
Analysts say the results could serve as an indication that French voters are disappointed with Sarkozy's economic policies that favor the rich when the nation is struggling with high unemployment and gloomy economic prospects.
A total of ten candidates faced off in the first round of voting, including far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who came third with one-fifth of the vote.
