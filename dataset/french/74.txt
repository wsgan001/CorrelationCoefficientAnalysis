Hollande and Sarkozy Go Through, But Le Pen Polls Strongly

French Socialist Francois Hollande came in ahead of President Nicolas Sarkozy in the first round of France¡¦s presidential elections Sunday, setting up a complex struggle for the incumbent to attract enough support from across the French political spectrum to have a shot at reelection on May. 6.

Both men easily qualified for the second round, with Mr. Hollande garnering between 27-28% of the vote, according to pollsters, compared to 25% to 27% for Mr. Sarkozy. Turnout was strong at an estimated 80.3%, although below the exceptionally strong voter participation seen in 2007.

National Front leader Marine Le Pen came in third place, with a surprisingly strong showing of 19% to 20%, while Leftist Front leader Jean-Luc Melenchon garnered between 10% and 12%.

Ms. Le Pen¡¦s performance suggests that Mr. Sarkozy has failed to attract far-right voters, despite his focus on law and order and his pledge to halve immigration if reelected for a second term.

The result underscores the deep disaffection with Mr. Sarkozy among French voters.
