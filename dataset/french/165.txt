Le Pen Supporters Cheer Poll Boost

As preliminary results of the French election first round vote came in, National Front supporters gathered at The Equinox venue in Paris exploded with joy, chanting the name of extreme far-right leader Marine Le Pen.

The National Front won an unexpected 19% of the vote, far above poll estimates, placing Ms. Le Pen third behind the Socialist Party・s Francois Hollande and President Nicolas Sarkozy.

：This is historical,； Florian Philippot, the National Front・s strategic director, said to reporters and party followers who had gathered around him at the venue.

：The fight has just started；, added Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine・s father and one of the party・s founders.

Ms. Le Pen later called on supporters to gather in Place de l・Opera, in central Paris on May 1st.

：I・ll let you know what I think； about the second round then, she said.

Supporters seemed to think the National Front leader won・t call her backers to vote for any other candidate in the second round.

：Sarkozy and Hollande have the same political agenda,； said Adrien Desport, 23, a party member from the Seine-et-Marne region, close to the French capital.

：Marine cannot be bought, she doesn・t negotiate.；

Mr. Desport said he・ll vote blank in the May 6 runoff, and that things are looking up for the National Front in the legislative elections, slated for June.

：They have forced Europe on us. Democracy was denied to us. Only Marine can free us,； added Gabriele Leone, a party member from Paris.

：We do not want globalization.；
