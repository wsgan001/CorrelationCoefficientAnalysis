French presidential election: Hollande-Sarkozy set to advance to french runoff

Paris: Socialist challenger Francois Hollande beat right-wing incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy in France・s first round presidential race Sunday, media reported on Sunday.
According to reports both candidates qualified for the second round, with Hollande taking 28 to 29 percent of the vote and Sarkozy 25 to 26, according to unofficial estimates from multiple sources.

：Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen came third with 17 percent,； they said.

The two 57-year-old political veterans, Hollande and Sarkozy, will thus face each other head-to-head in a May 6 run-off, which will decide who runs what is commonly regarded as the world・s fifth greatest power for the next five years.

Recent opinion polls in France pointed to the right-wing incumbent President Nicolas Sarkozy (L) coming second to his Socialist challenger Francois Hollande.

France・s feeble economy could make Sarkozy the country・s first president to lose a fight for re-election in more than 30 years.
