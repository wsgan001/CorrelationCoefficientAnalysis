French Presidential Election Leaves Hollande, Sarkozy and Many Questions

Socialist challenger Francois Hollande came out ahead of French President Nicolas Sarkozy in the first round of France¡¦s presidential election Sunday, winning 28.6 percent of votes cast, compared to 27.2 percent for Sarkozy.

The two will now face each other in a run-off election on May 6. Until then, the European Union will be holding its breath, as the implications of the election results will extend far beyond France¡¦s borders.
