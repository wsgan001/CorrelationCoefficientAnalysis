First round of French presidential election to be held in 2 days

The French have two days to decide on their political preferences and cast their ballots for which of the 10 presidential candidates they think will suit them best, in the first round of the election, due on April 22nd.

It was only once in the history of the Fifth Republic that General Charles de Gaulle won the election in the first round in 1958. Nor is there an obvious leader in this year¡¦s election. According to sociological surveys, the Incumbent President Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande of the 

Socialist Party are running neck and neck. Hollande grew popular due to the sliding popularity of Sarkozy, who¡¦s held responsible for the economic crisis. Unemployment figures have grown by 730,000 over the term of his presidency. The second round has been set for May 6th
