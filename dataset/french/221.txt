French president Nicolas Sarkozy pledges tough anti-immigration policies in bid to win election

FRENCH president Nicolas Sarkozy has pledged to win over far-right voters with controversial anti-immigration policies after a shock vote.

Sarkozy finished second ¡V the first time this has happened to a sitting president ¡V in the first round of the French presidential elections.

While he finished up on 27.1 per cent of the votes, Socialist rival Francois Hollande won 28.6 per cent.

But the balance of power in the tightest presidential contest in a generation now rests with National Front candidate Marine Le Pen.

She caused the biggest upset of the campaign by coming third with more than 18 per cent of votes.

The result represents the largest share of the vote the extremist National Front have ever won.

In the next round of voting, the run-off in a fortnight¡¦s time, Le Pen¡¦s supporters will choose between Sarkozy and Hollande.

This means they could decide who will be the next president of France.

Le Pen has stayed tight-lipped over who she¡¦ll support ¡V and won¡¦t make an announcement until the start of next month.

Back on the campaign trail yesterday, Sarkozy, 57, said: ¡§I have heard you. There was this crisis vote. An answer must be given to this crisis vote.¡¨

He said French values will be upheld with ¡§respect for our borders, the fight against factories moving abroad, controlling immigration and the security of our families¡¨.

Many of those who voted for the National Front are angry at high unemployment and slow economic growth during Sarkozy¡¦s presidency.

And the millions who backed him in the last elections in 2007 believe he¡¦s become a president for the rich, and was distracted by his third marriage to Carla Bruni.

If Hollande wins he will become the first Socialist president in France in 17 years.
