French voters head to the polls

Polls outside large cities closed at 6 p.m. Paris time, or noon Eastern. Polls close in large cities at 8 p.m.

The French Interior Ministry said 70.6% of France¡¦s more than 44 million eligible voters had cast ballots by 5 p.m. Paris time, according to cable news channel France 24.

That lags the 73.7% that had voted by the same time in the first-round of the 2007 presidential election but is far ahead of the pace seen in 2002.

French news media are prohibited from issuing projections until all polls closed.

President Nicolas Sarkozy and Socialist challenger Francois Hollande are expected to emerge from the first-round vote to face each other in a head-to-head runoff on May 6.

Most polls show Hollande beating Sarkozy in a runoff.
