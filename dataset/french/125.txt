French elections: Hollande 27. 7% Sarko 26. 6%; Le Pen, 19. 7%

(AGI) Paris - In the first round of the French presidential elections challenger Hollande is ahead of France's incumbent President Nicolas Sarkozy. However France's conservative soul is growing stronger as proven by the oustanding result Marine Le Pen was able to secure for herself. She is third with 19.7% of the ballots, topping her father's result who in 2002 had 17% of the vote. Mr. Le Pen defeated socialist candidate Jospin and went to the run-off with Chirac. With 56% of the vote counted, Francois Hollande got 27.7% of the ballots and Nicolas Sarkozy 26.6%, while Marine Le Pen had 19.7%. Although it would be a formally unlikely theory because of the 'conventio ad excludendum' of the untouchable far-right , if Sarkozy's 26.6% was added to Le Pen's 19.7%, the total would be 46.3% vs 40.17% which would be the likely and legal sum of Hollande's 27.7% , Melenchon's 10.4% and Eva Joly's 2%. It is evident that France's incumbent President will have to go out of his way to win the support of the voters of the far-right, if he wants to win the race
