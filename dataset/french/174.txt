France election 2012: Nicolas Sarkozy says far-Right vote cannot be ignored

"We must respect the voters' will, it is our duty to listen," Sarkozy told journalists. "There was this crisis vote that doubled from one election to another, an answer must be given to this crisis vote."

Le Pen's score Sunday was nearly double the 10.4 percent her father Jean-Marie took as the National Front (FN) candidate in the 2007 first round.

Sarkozy also went on the offensive with a challenge to Hollande, who won the first round with 28.63 percent to 27.08 percent for Sarkozy, not to refuse his proposal for three televised debates before the May 6 second round.

"This is about debating before the French people, project against project, personality against personality, experience against experience. The French people have a right to know, Mr. Hollande must not run away."

Sarkozy proposed the three debates on Sunday but Hollande said one would be enough.
