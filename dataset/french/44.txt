Hollande and Sarkozy lead opinion polls ahead of Sunday¡¦s 1st round of French Presidential election

With only a few days to go in the first round of the campaign for the Elysee Palace, outgoing President Nicolas Sarkozy has recovered to lie almost neck and neck with Socialist challenger Francois Hollande.

According to the latest opinion polls by Harris Interactive, Hollande has 27.5% with Sarkozy on 26.5%. The National Front leader Marine Le Pen is third on 16%.

In fourth place is far left challenger Jean-Luc Melenchon on 12%.

Only the top two will go head to head in the second round, two weeks later.

Sarkozy has argued that a vote for Le Pen is a vote for Hollande with a split in the right vote. Responding, Le Pen, the daughter of Jean-Marie, said on French TV that ¡¥a vote for Marine Le Pen is really a vote for Marine Le Pen¡¦.

President Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni will vote at 1130 CET at a polling station in Paris on Sunday morning.
