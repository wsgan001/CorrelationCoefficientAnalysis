Voting begins in France's presidential elections

The French have headed to the polls in the the first round of the presidential elections.

Nicolas Sarkozy could become the country's first president to lose a fight for re-election in more than 30 years.

Sarkozy is battling Socialist opponent Francois Hollande in the second round. Opinion polls have given the challenger a double-digit lead for a May 6 runoff.

Sarkozy moved briefly into the lead in polls for the first round on April 22 following his handling of a shooting drama in south-western France in March, but he has slipped back again.

Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, hard leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon and centrist Francois Bayrou rank in third, fourth and fifth place for the April 22 first round between 10 candidates.
