Socialist Challenger Francois Hollande looks ready to win the presidency in run-off voting next week.

The first round of voting in the French presidential election is set for Sunday, and polls point to Nicolas Sarkozy becoming the first one-term president in France since 1981. As it stands now, Sarkozy is neck-and-neck with the Socialist candidate Francois Hollande, who's campaigned on a message of higher taxes and growing the French economy instead of taking austerity measures (good luck with that, by the way) and an early withdrawal from Afghanistan. There are eight other candidates running as well, including Marine Le Pen of the Front National, but France's electoral system forces a run-off between the top-two candidates in the first round of balloting. And with Sarkozy and Hollande looking like the two to square off in a run-off set for May 6, polls indicate that Hollande boasts a margin of between seven and 14 percentage points over Sarkozy. The president has made a last-ditch appeal to voters over his handling of the euro crisis, explaining that had he not been in charge, France's economy could have fared far worse. We suppose we'll find out which message voters are buying come Sunday.
