French presidential election: Hollande on top in first round

Francois Hollande charged back into campaign mode on Monday in his bid to capture France's presidency.

The Socialist candidate won the most votes in the first round, setting him against right-wing President Nicolas Sarkozy in the run-off.

"Now I become the candidate of all the forces who want to turn one page and turn over another," Mr Hollande told people in Tulle.

However, it may be the fifth of voters who picked far-right candidate Marine Le Pen who decide the result of May 6's vote.

But Mr Hollande, who wants to tax the super-rich at 75 per cent, is still the favourite.

If he wins, he would become the first Socialist president since 1995. It would also nudge Europe's political and economic landscape to the left.

Polls on Sunday night suggested that Mr Hollande is likely to beat Mr Sarkozy in their head-to-head matchup two weeks from now by around 10 percentage points, just as most polls have predicted for months.

The pair resumed campaigning on Monday after a two-day pause for the first-round vote.

Mr Sarkozy, who is battling to avoid becoming France's first one-term president since Valery Giscard d'Estaing lost to Socialist Francois Mitterrand in 1981, suggested he'd ramp up his right-wing rhetoric to attract National Front voters.

"National Front voters must be respected, they've expressed a choice," he said on Monday.

"I say to them, I've heard you. I'll draw all the consequences."

Ms Le Pen came third with 17.9 per cent, the best showing ever by the National Front party founded by her father Jean-Marie Le Pen.

Left Front candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon came fourth with 11.1 per cent, followed by centrist Francois Bayrou with 9.1 per cent and five other candidates with minimal support.

Turnout was high, at more than 80 per cent.
