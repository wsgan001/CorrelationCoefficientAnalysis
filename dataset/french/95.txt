Turnout solid, but less than in 2007, in first round of French presidential election

PARIS ¡X The Interior Ministry says more than one in four French voters in the first round of France¡¦s presidential election cast ballots before noon ¡X a solid turnout compared to recent years.

After a provisional noontime count, the ministry said over 28 per cent of France¡¦s 44-million-plus registered voters had cast ballots.

It was less than the 31 per cent at the same time in the 2007 first-round vote, but more than in the four previous races.

Sunday¡¦s balloting will winnow down a list of 10 candidates to two finalists for a May 6 runoff.

Polls have showed that President Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande, a Socialist, are likely to make the cut.

A high abstention rate could alter the political terrain by giving more influence to more ideological ¡X and less centrist ¡X voters.
