Sarkozy, Hollande head for presidential runoff

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhuanet) -- Early results from the first round of France¡¦s presidential election indicate Socialist Francois Hollande has won the most votes. Conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy came a close second. The two will now compete in a runoff vote on May 6th. This is according to partial results from an election that could alter the European political and economic landscape.

With about 80 percent of the votes counted, Hollande had a provisional score of 28 percent, against 26.9 percent for Sarkozy.

The two will meet in a head-to-head decider on May 6th.

Far-rightist Marine Le Pen threw the race wide open by scoring nearly 19 percent in the first round.

Supporters of Socialist candidate Francois Hollande celebrated their win in the first round.

Reacting from inside the headquarters, Socialist Party members stressed that the race for the Elysee Palace was not yet won.

Member of Socialist Party Jack Lang said, "The campaign for the second round is not only the mathematics of counting votes. What is important is the dynamics which are created. Francois Hollande is on top, the actual President is second, a couple of percentage points behind. We should not count the reserve of votes. Former French socialist President Francois Mitterrand was always saying that 2 + 2 is never 4 that can be only 3 or 5. I hope we will make 5, that we will mobilise all voters whatever their vote was in the first round."

The election is being seen as a referendum on conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy at a time when many French voters are worried about high unemployment and weak economic prospects.

As Socialist Francois Hollande heads into the presidential election runoff with Sarkozy, he has pledged to cut France¡¦s debt and boost growth and jobs, if he wins the presidency.
