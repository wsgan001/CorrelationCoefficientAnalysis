Turnout good halfway through French presidential vote

Turnout was strong a third of the way through voting in the first round of France's presidential election Sunday, at 28.29 percent down only slightly from 31.21 in the 2007 poll, officials said.

The 2007 race, when right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy beat Socialist Segolene Royal in a passionately fought race, was an exceptional year -- and Sunday's turnout was far in excess of the 2002 figure at the same point in polling.

Polling opened at 8.00am (0600 GMT) in mainland France, and by midday there were queues at many voting centres, despite opinion pollsters warning that the election would be marred by a higher rate abstention than normal.

Voting was to end between 6.00pm and 8.00pm.

In 2007, almost 74 percent of registered voters turned out to vote in the first round, but the 2012 campaigns of incumbent Sarkozy and his Socialist challenger Francois Hollande have not drawn crowds.

Sunday's first round will serve to whittle the field down from 10 candidate to two -- in all likelihood Hollande and Sarkozy -- and the frontrunners will face each other in a second-round run-off on May 6.
