French elections first round results : Sarkozy 25.5% , Hollande 28.4%

Exit polls from the French presidential elections show Socialist candidate Francois Hollande with 28.4% of the vote and President Nicolas Sarkozy with 25.5%, French officials announced Sunday. A presidential candidate must receive more than 50% of the vote to win office. If no one claims a majority in the first round of voting, the top two vote-getters advance to a second round of voting.

The runoff would take place May 6. In addition to Sarkozy and Hollande, candidates include Jean-Luc Melenchon on the extreme left with 11.7%, Marine Le Pen on the extreme right with 20%, and centrist Francois Bayrou with 8.5%.
