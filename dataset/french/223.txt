French show euroscepticism

ON the face of it, Nicolas Sarkozy's position after voting in the first round of the French presidential election looks grim indeed.

Not for 50 years has an incumbent seeking re-election come second and gone on to win.

That is the challenge confronting him as he seeks to reverse what appears to be the inevitability of victory for the socialist Francois Hollande. Mr Hollande emerged with 28 per cent of the vote against 27 per cent for Mr Sarkozy. But the socialists should be cautious -- although he may look down and out, Mr Sarkozy is nothing if not a determined fighter and the stunning success of Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front in winning more than 18 per cent of the vote off the back of anti-immigrant sentiment will give the incumbent hope he may yet snatch victory. But it's going to be an uphill battle. The beleaguered economy and Mr Sarkozy's widely criticised handling of the eurozone crisis are at the centre of his electoral doldrums. Voter disenchantment is overwhelming. One in three backed extremist parties on the Left and Right opposed to the EU. Despite this, Mr Hollande has few answers, airily maintaining his true enemy is the "world of finance" and promising the usual socialist panacea of swingeing wealth taxes. Both main contenders have much to do before either inspires much confidence.
