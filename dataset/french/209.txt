Summary Box: Markets worried at French Socialist?

THE WIN: Socialist candidate Francois Hollande came out on top in the first round of France's presidential election on Sunday.

THE FALLOUT: The stock markets tumbled and the euro slid, but analysts cautioned that the nearly 3 percent fall in the country's CAC-40 index and the euro's 0.5 percent retreat against the dollar may have more to do with worries about Europe overall than fear of a left-wing resident in the Elysee Palace.

THE CONTEXT: Most polls had predicted Hollande would edge out President Nicolas Sarkozy in this round. The real surprise was far-right candidate Marine Le Pen's strong showing.
