Sarkozy, Hollande Advance to Runoff

(AP) ¡V French President Nicolas Sarkozy and chief rival Francois Hollande are headed for a showdown on May 6, after finishing as the top two candidates in today's first round of voting in France's presidential elections. Though the French government has yet to finalize the tally, the Wall Street Journal and other outlets are reporting that Sarkozy captured between 25% and 26% of the vote, while Hollande took in 27% to 29%. Since no one won more than half, both candidates head to the runoff, where previous polling had suggested that the Socialist Hollande could deny Sarkozy his bid for re-election.
