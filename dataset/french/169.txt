France News - Hollande leads Sarkozy in first round of French Presidential Election

Nicolas Sarkozy and the Socialist leader Francois Hollande will battle it out to be the new French president on 6th May after they scored the highest percentages of the vote in the first round of the election yesterday. Hollande took approximately 28.7% of the vote and Sarkozy 27.1%. The next nearest challenger was the far right candidate, Marine Le Pen, with 18.5%. A troubling sign of discontent of the current administration in France at the moment. 

In the Midi-Pyrenees, the vote was more in favour of Hollande, who took around 32% of the vote, coompared to Sarkozy's 23% and Marine le Pen claiming around 18%.

The next question that the France media is asking is where will the votes go in the second round? It is clear that the 11% of people who voted for the far left party (Jean-Luc Melenchon) will be voting for the socialist candidate. However, it is expected that only 60% of the far right voters will cast their vote for Sarkozy. The centrist candidate, Bayrou, obtained less than 10% of popular vote, but his support seems to be split evenly between the left and right. 

Latest predictions give Hollande 54% in the second round with Sarkozy on 46%. The battle started last night, with Sarkozy's speech in Paris challending Hollande to 3 debates on tv in the next two weeks, which Hollande has refused. Expect Sarkozy to be on the attack as the underdog in the coming fight.
