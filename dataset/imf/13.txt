France's Lagarde, IMF Candidate, Rules Out Debt Restructuring

PARIS (MNI) - French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde argued Sunday against a restructuring of Greece's debt in order to maintain pressure on Athens for further budget consolidation.

While officially a candidate for the succession of Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the helm of the International Monetary Fund, Lagarde is still a member of the government of Nicolas Sarkozy, who said Friday at the G-8 summit that the "r" word would not be part of France's vocabulary. At the same time, Sarkozy supported Germany's position that governments and their taxpayers should not shoulder the full burden of the financial crisis.

Asked in a radio interview whether restructuring should be considered as an option for the heavily indebted Greek government, Lagarde replied: "No. I say it in a very clear way, because we must imperatively maintain a balance" between financial solidarity in the Eurozone and adjustment efforts by each government receiving aid.

"In exchange, we expect efforts," she declared.

Greece has started to consolidate its budget in a big way, the minister acknowledged. "But it must continue. It must make a number of privatizations, which unfortunately have not really started to this day. And then there are structural reforms" of the kind that France has already launched to liberalize its economy, she added.

Lagarde also explained in more detail than she had in the past her reasons for resorting to judicial arbitration in the long and costly litigation with entrepreneur Bernard Tapie, which ended up costing the French government E285 million. Had the case gone to trial, the government might have lost as much as E7 billion, she asserted.

The French public prosecutor has demanded an investigation into the minister's role in the decision -- a Damocles sword hanging over her candidacy for the IMF.

"My conscience is perfectly tranquil," Lagarde reiterated.
