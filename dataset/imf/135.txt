Agustin Carstens arrives in Argentina on Friday, the latest stop on his charm offensive to drum up votes for his candidacy as IMF chief over that of France¡¦s Christine Lagarde. Is it doomed?

Argentina is likely to be very polite ¡V Carstens, the Mexican central bank chief, is a fellow Latin American and Argentina hates nothing more than being told what to do by developed countries it sees as too ready to spout the very orthodox economic ideas it believe led it to ruin.

But that¡¦s the problem with how they see Carstens ¡V his Chicago Boy background and orthodox outlook on some questions jar.

Nothing can convince Argentina that the IMF was not in part responsible for its monster economic collapse in 2001-02, with a sovereign default on nearly $100bn and a brutal devaluation. Nor will the government be swayed from its belief that only by refusing to do as it had always been told, and by its adoption of heterodox politicies that have led to rampant growth (critics call it overheating), has it emerged like a phoenix from the ashes.

In Argentina last week, the head of the Inter-American Development Bank, Luis Alberto Moreno, lauded Carstens as having the right credentials and experience to take the helm of the IMF.

Carstens thinks so too, arguing here that emerging markets have the kind of experience that can benefit global policymaking.

But in the end, recent bilateral trade spats aside, Argentina may end up backing whoever its bigger, BRIC-member neighbour Brazil does. And despite Carstens¡¦ efforts to drum up support in Brazil this week, he might find he is flogging a dead horse.
