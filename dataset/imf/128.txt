Germany's Merkel not opposed to non-European IMF head in long run


(Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday she supports French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde as the next International Monetary Fund chief, but said that she was not opposed to non-European candidates assuming the top post in future.

In the long run, it is not sustainable for an American to head the World Bank and a European to head the IMF, she told an audience during a visit to Singapore.

Merkel, who was speaking in German, also urged developing countries to take an unbiased look at Lagarde, who is a strong favorite to win the post and who France says has the backing of the G8 group of leading economic powers.

The top IMF job came open after Dominique Strauss-Kahn was arrested and charged for sexual assault and attempted rape of a maid in a Manhattan hotel.

His resignation has led to calls from developing countries to end the traditional lock on the job.

Brazil on Wednesday welcomed Carstens' candidacy as a step forward for emerging economies but stopped short of offering an endorsement, saying it needed more time to decide which candidate to back.
