Courting Rationality: An Emerging IMF Chief? 

Economics holds that people are rational beings. But the models don't really account for questions like "what on earth was he thinking?"¡Xwhich arose after International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn's alleged sexual assault of a hotel maid in Manhattan.

Strauss-Kahn is expected to plead not guilty at his arraignment Monday. But another question¡X"What on earth are they thinking?"¡Xstill preoccupies emerging-markets officials, amid intense lobbying for a new IMF chief, thanks to Strauss-Kahn's resignation. 

Europeans have held the post since the IMF's post- World War II launch; Strauss-Kahn is French. But emerging markets are acutely aware of their importance to the global economy. The idea that a European will get the post, however critical to a debt solution, rankles. Among the candidates: French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde and Mexico's central-bank governor, Agustin Carstens, once a top IMF official.

The IMF's board, which must vote by June 30, will have to tread cautiously. The new chief doesn't have to come from the emerging markets for their prospects to remain positive, says Michael Spence, Nobel prize-winning economist and author of The Next Convergence: The Future of Economic Growth in a Multispeed World. Emerging markets have "a direct stake" in resolving the debt crisis, because "there's lots of risk [of] another downturn." But they want to be seen as having "a real voice," says Spence. He thinks Lagarde will probably win: "The challenge is to make sure she gets in the right way, on the merits." That seems the most rational solution.
