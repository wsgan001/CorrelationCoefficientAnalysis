'Developing countries want open IMF selection'

Developing countries are dismayed that European countries are pushing for another European head of the International Monetary Fund, according to Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.

Addressing Parliament's finance committee on Tuesday, Gordhan pointed out that in 2008 a commitment had been made by the Group of 20 countries to transform the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and make it more open, transparent and relevant.

The IMF and its sister organisation, The World Bank, have traditionally been headed by a European and American respectively since their formation more than 60 years ago.

Since the arrest and resignation of Dominique Strauss-Kahn in the US two weeks ago, speculation has been rife as to who would head up the organisation.

Gordhan said nothing about his predecessor, Trevor Manuel, who is now Minister in the Presidency for National Planning, as being a candidate for that appointment.

Gordhan read from the 2008 communique that made a commitment to transforming those two financial institutions.

He then read out the relevant paragraph of the communique, saying: "As part of a comprehensive reform package, we agree that the heads and the senior leadership of all international institutions should be appointed through an open, transparent and merit-based system."

Gordhan commented that this implied that the IMF and World Bank were no longer part of the deal.

He said the Brics economic grouping of emerging market states, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and SA, had issued a statement last week asking that the selection of a new IMF head be done in accordance with that declaration.
