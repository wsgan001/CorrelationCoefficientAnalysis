Lagarde Vows to Seek Bigger Role for Developing Countries at IMF

May 31 (Bloomberg) -- French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde promised to give developing nations a greater voice at the International Monetary Fund if she succeeds in her bid to become the lender・s next managing director.

：It・s important to allow countries to have a lot of representation,； Lagarde said yesterday during a visit to Brazil before heading for China. ：I chose Brazil as my first destination in the campaign because it・s a big emerging country that carries a lot of weight in the international scene.；

Brazil and other developing countries are seeking to break a half-century tradition whereby the top IMF job is reserved for a European. Speaking alongside Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega, Lagarde, who has won endorsements for her bid from across Europe, said being French is neither an advantage nor a drawback to her candidacy.

At a later press conference in Brasilia, Lagarde said the IMF has a role to improve coordination among countries to ensure more predictable and stable currencies. Last year, Mantega complained that countries were competitively devaluing their exchange rates in a global ：currency war.；

Mantega told reporters yesterday that emerging nations have no plans to rally around a single candidate and that Brazil would decide who to support after hearing each nominee・s proposals. Mexican Central Bank Governor Agustin Carstens, who is trying to win backing from developing countries for his rival bid, visits Brasilia on June 1.

．Democratic Spirit・

：We think it・s good that there・s a variety of candidates because it shows that there・s a democratic spirit,； Mantega said.

Brazil will privately support Lagarde・s candidacy to run the IMF, a Brazilian government official familiar with the negotiations said May 24. Carstens probably won・t have enough votes to win, said the official, who requested anonymity because he isn・t authorized to speak publicly about the issue.

In exchange for its support for the European candidate, Brazil will push for Lagarde to run the IMF only until the end of next year, when former head Dominique Strauss-Kahn・s term would have expired, the official said. Brazil doesn・t plan to declare that support openly, he said.

：Nationality shouldn・t be a qualification to head the IMF,； Mantega said today. ：This rule is outdated.；

Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on May 27 voiced his support for Lagarde, joining the U.K., Germany and Sweden. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has praised Lagarde・s qualifications while refraining from endorsing her candidacy. Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said today Japan has no preferred candidate at this point.

IMF Tradition

IMF executive directors representing Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa have protested a tradition dating back to the fund・s creation after World War II that its leader always be a European.

Mantega today said Brazil ：welcomes； Lagarde・s nomination and he praised her qualifications, though he said the fact that the next IMF chief will be absorbed by problems in Europe doesn・t mean they need to come from there.

The IMF said it aims to complete by June 30 the selection of Strauss-Kahn・s successor. Countries from the European Union hold about 31 percent of the votes at the agency and the U.S. almost 17 percent. Emerging market and developing countries saw their share of votes increase to 42 percent, from 40.5 percent, under Strauss-Kahn・s management.

Europe・s Bailouts

The IMF, which provided a record $91.7 billion in emergency loans last year and accounts for one-third of the euro-region・s bailout packages, has promised transparency in the selection process.

Strauss-Kahn resigned from the post this month to defend himself against charges that he sexually assaulted and raped a maid at a Manhattan hotel. Lagarde would be the first woman to lead the IMF since its founding in 1945.

Mexico・s Carstens served as IMF deputy managing director from 2003 to 2006. He has a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago, and took the reins of Mexico・s central bank in January 2010 after serving as the country・s finance minister.
