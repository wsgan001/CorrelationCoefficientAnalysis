Lagarde to begin campaign for IMF top post in India

French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde will begin her campaign for the top job at the International Monetary Fund from India.

Lagarde, who is seeking to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn who resigned after he was charged with sexual assault on a hotel maid in New York, is expected to visit New Delhi shortly and will meet top Indian officials, seeking their support for her candidacy.

French defence minister Gerard Longuet, who is on a two-day visit to India said that the 55-year-old has chosen New Delhi to start her campaign due to her long association with India. He did not give more details on the planned visit but said that ¡¥India¡¦s significance has been made clear¡¦ by the fact that New Delhi will be one of the first places she will visit as she tries to garner support from the international community.

Lagarde, who is considered to be the frontrunner for the top post as she has support in the US and Europe, has been trying get developing countries on board, given criticism for the unwritten rule that IMF has to be headed by a European while the World Bank is governed by an American.
