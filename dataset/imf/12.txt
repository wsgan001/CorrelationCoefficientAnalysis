Lagarde Has G-8¡¦s Endorsement for IMF Top Job

The leaders of all G-8 member nations backed French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde¡¦s bid for the International Monetary Fund¡¦s top job, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on Sunday.

¡§Among the eight heads of state and government, plus the president of the European Commission and the president of the European Council who were there, there was unanimous support for Christine Lagarde,¡¨ Juppe said on French television channel Canal+, as cited by Reuters.

Even though the IMF leadership was not on the official G-8 agenda, the G-8 nations¡XCanada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Britain, and the United States¡Xmost likely discussed the succession for its significant impact on international affairs.

The United States stuck with its policy of not siding with any specific candidate.

¡§I won¡¦t go beyond what we¡¦ve said, which is we support the process that¡¦s been set up by the IMF to find a successor, and we support the process that produces the best possible candidate,¡¨ White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a press briefing when asked to comment on G-8¡¦s endorsement of Lagarde. 

One of Lagarde¡¦s biggest obstacles on her path to becoming the first woman to lead the global lender is the possibility of a formal inquiry into her role in a 2008 legal settlement involving paying 285 million euros (US$408 million) to businessman Bernard Tapie, a friend and political ally of French President Nicolas Sarkozy.

The IMF has always elected a European to head the organization since it was created following World War II.
