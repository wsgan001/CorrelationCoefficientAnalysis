Asia needs to push a single candidate for IMF -- Tetangco

Asia needs to rally behind a candidate to ensure that one of its own takes the top job at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) but this has proven to be a challenge, said the country・s central bank chief.
"There・s a need to see if Asian countries can rally behind a single candidate. We don・t have that yet. It・s something that should be pursued and explored," Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Amando M. Tetangco, Jr. told reporters yesterday.

"There are names that have been mentioned like Singapore・s and India・s, but there・s nothing concrete, yet," he said.

Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapore・s finance minister and chairman of the IMF・s International Monetary and Financial Committee, and Montek Singh Ahluwalia, India・s Planning Commission deputy chairman, have been floated as Asian candidates for IMF chief, after Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned due to sexual assault allegations.

Finance Secretary Cesar V. Purisima, in a text message to BusinessWorld, concurred, saying Asian leaders should rally behind a nominee to ensure that an Asian takes the IMF・s top job.

Messrs. Tetangco and Purisima, along with other Asian leaders, have been stressing it・s high time that an Asian takes the helm at the IMF.

Mr. Tetangco explained that shifts in the balance of global economic power should be reflected in the new IMF leadership. "I think that because of the shift in economic power that has taken place in past years, an Asian leader should really be considered," he said.

The top IMF post has been traditionally held by a European, in the same way that an American is always named president of the World Bank. Developing countries have long chafed at these arrangements.

France・s Christine Lagarde, who enjoys European backing, has announced her candidacy for the IMF・s top job. She will be touring China and India to get these two countries・ support.
