Lagarde says committed to IMF reform

BRASILIA ¡X French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde pledged to push reforms to give Brazil and other emerging economies more influence at the International Monetary Fund as she kicked off a worldwide tour to win support for her candidacy to lead the global lender.
The backing of Brazil, Latin America's largest economy and an influential diplomatic power, could help ease discontent among developing countries over the long-standing practice of choosing a European to head the IMF.
Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said Brazil had yet to decide whether to support Lagarde or her only declared rival, Mexican central bank chief Agustin Carstens. But he underscored the need for more reforms to give emerging economies a greater voice in the IMF, something Lagarde was eager to stress she supported.
Before Lagarde's visit, Brazilian officials said in private that President Dilma Rousseff is inclined to back her candidacy as long as she pledges to continue reforming the IMF. They see Lagarde as having more clout to push reforms than Carstens, who arrives in Brazil today in search of backing.
"If I was elected, I'd make sure that the diversity of members is represented at all levels," Lagarde told reporters at a news conference in Brazil's capital, Brasilia.
Lagarde, who is a strong favourite to win the post and has the backing of the G8 group of leading economic powers, also said it was important for the IMF to increase international co-operation to avoid excessive currency swings.
She said she did not discuss with Brazilian officials the possibility of her serving a shortened term as IMF chief until the end of 2012, when Strauss-Kahn's tenure would have ended. Lagarde has made clear she is seeking a full five-year term.
