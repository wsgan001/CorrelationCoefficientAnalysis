South Africa・s Gordhan Says He Is ．Surprised・ About G8 Backing for Lagarde

South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said European countries conspired ：behind closed doors； to impose Christine Lagarde as the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund.

：Well before nominations closed on the 10th of June, we already see the traditional deals being made around tables at which even the major emerging-market economies were not present,； Gordhan said today in an interview broadcast on Johannesburg-based SAFM radio. ：Europe shot off ahead of everybody else, with virtually no decorum. You don・t want deals behind closed doors that exclude developing countries.；

Group of Eight countries unanimously backed French Finance Minister Lagarde, Alain Juppe, the country・s foreign minister said in an interview with Canal+ yesterday. The IMF wants to find a new head by the end of next month, after incumbent Dominique Strauss-Kahn stepped down to defend charges of attempted rape.

Emerging-market nations have been ：hard at work； to unite behind a candidate from developing countries, Gordhan said. Meanwhile, China and Brazil, the two largest emerging economies, may also back Lagarde over the candidacy of Mexican central bank governor, Agustin Carstens. South African Planning Minister Trevor Manuel, who has been named as a potential candidate, has called for a more open appointment process.
