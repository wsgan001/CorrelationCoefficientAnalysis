Lagarde Will Visit Brazil in Effort to Win Support for IMF Bid

French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde will travel to Brazil on May 30 as part of an effort to broaden support in developing countries for her candidacy to head the International Monetary Fund.

The one-day visit to Brazil won・t include other stops, a spokesman at the Finance Ministry said today. He declined to be cited by name, under department policy. Lagarde will also travel to China, though a date hasn・t been set.

Lagarde, who announced her candidacy May 25, has won endorsements from across Europe. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin yesterday voiced his support for her, joining the U.K., Germany and Sweden. IMF executive directors representing Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa have protested a presumption that the fund・s next chief come from Europe.

France・s Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned from the post after being arrested on charges of sexual assault and attempted rape in New York. Lagarde would be the first woman to lead the IMF since its founding in 1945.
