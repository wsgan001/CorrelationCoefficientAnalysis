IMF needs sweeping reforms ¡V Christine Lagarde

The International Monetary Fund needs sweeping reforms, says the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde. She is the front-runner for the IMF Post.

The BBC quotes Lagarde as saying that the new Fund Managing Director should be elected in keeping with their achievement and irrespective of their nationality.

Europeans have traditionally headed the Fund. The previous IMF Director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn of France, stepped down amid a major scandal. Two weeks ago, he was accused of attempted rape in New York, and has been placed under house arrest for the trial period.

The new IMF Managing Director is due to be elected before the end of June.
