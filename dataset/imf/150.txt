IMF: developing nations yet to find serious rival to Lagarde

French finance minister Christine Lagarde is expected to travel to India this week to drum up support for her candidacy as managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with just days to go for developing countries to unite behind a non-European contender.

In the wake of Dominique Strauss-Kahn's humiliating resignation, the Bric countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China, condemned the long-standing convention that a European runs the Washington-based lender.

But with nominations closing on Friday, they have so far failed to unite behind an alternative to Lagarde, who has the backing of European countries including Germany and Britain.

Russia has proposed Kazakhstan's central banker Grigory Marchenko, but he has little support outside the ex-Soviet bloc countries. Agustin Carstens, Mexico's central bank governor, has put himself forward, but as a Chicago-trained economist is too orthodox for governments hoping for radical change at the IMF.

Jo-Marie Griesgraber, director of the US campaign network New Rules for Global Finance, said: "What's depressing is that developing countries can't get their act together, frankly." Matthew Martin, of Development Finance International, said he was amazed: "There are plenty of excellent people who know what they're doing in developing countries."
