Germany's Merkel: Lagarde Is Ideal Embodiment Of Economic, Political Experience For IMF 

SINGAPORE (Dow Jones)--German Chancellor Angela Merkel Thursday said French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde has the economic and political experience to head the International Monetary Fund.

"If I look at the personality of Christine Lagarde, as a finance minister, she enjoys an excellent reputation worldwide, and in many ways is an ideal embodiment of economic and political experience," Merkel said.

Merkel said that in the long-run, it is unacceptable to think that a European IMF head and a U.S. World Bank head would be automatic, but now might not be the right time to alter that model.

"Since the IMF is very deeply involved in the euro matters, there could be good reasons for not saying right away that a European candidate is out of the question," the German chancellor said.

Merkel said she hoped emerging countries would take "an objective and unbiased look at" Lagarde for the post.

Merkel's remarks came as she delivered a lecture hosted by the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.

By tradition a European has always headed the IMF, but many in Asia and other emerging economies say the practice is outdated. The IMF job came open after the resignation of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a former French finance minister arrested last month on charges he attempted to rape a maid in a New York hotel. Strauss-Kahn denies all charges.
