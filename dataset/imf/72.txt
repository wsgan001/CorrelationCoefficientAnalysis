South Africa could have democratic process to get a new IMF boss as the South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, on Tuesday has suggested the International Monetary Fund to adopt a democratic system in order to choose the institution's next leader.

He further added in his statement, "We are talking about a shift from a decades-old tradition to a new way of doing things. We're talking about a shift from an entitlement to heading certain institutions to a more democratic process. This is an important institution and I think there are also important historical issues at stake, whether the institution continue to operate in the old way, whether the 21st century has indeed arrived for everyone concerned".

Gordhan declined to say anything regarding the issues that whom South Africa would be backing for the post i. e. the respected head of the National Planning Commission, Trevor Manuel, or French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, who has recently launched a charm offensive in Brazil in order to win support of most of the emerging economies for her IMF candidacy.

BRICS group of emerging economic powers is a big one, which comprises of South Africa, Brazil, Russia, India and China. The group has majorly criticized Europe's grip on the IMF and thus will be soon coming out with a candidate of their own choice but till date no choices have been made.
