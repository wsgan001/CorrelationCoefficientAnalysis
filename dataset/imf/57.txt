Salgado Says Mexico Controls Spain・s Vote for Next IMF Chief

Spain・s support for Christine Lagarde in the race to lead the IMF may take a backseat to Mexico, which is trying to install its own candidate and controls the vote of the caucus on which Spain sits at the Washington-based lender.

Finance Minister Elena Salgado said Spain backs her French counterpart Lagarde to be the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Still, the country shares a voting chair in the fund with Mexico and other Latin American countries, with Mexico holding the rotating executive directorship of that seat, Salgado said.

：We have to separate our presence in a chair, in which the vote is indivisible,； from Spain・s support for Lagarde, who would be an ：excellent candidate,； Salgado told a news conference in Madrid today.

Mexico and other developing nations are seeking to break a half-century tradition whereby the top IMF job is reserved for a European, and Central Bank Governor Agustin Carstens is trying to win backing for his bid. The IMF said on May 21 it will aim to pick a leader to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn by the end of June and promised to choose the most-qualified candidate from among front-runners announced by the agency.
