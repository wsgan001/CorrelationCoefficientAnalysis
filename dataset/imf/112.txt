India Minister: Suggested Talks To Back A Candidate For IMF Top Job

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India has suggested its executive director at the International Monetary Fund to discuss with several other countries to find a way to agree on backing a single candidate for the top job at the multilateral lender, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said Wednesday.

"Currently there are four-five candidates," Mukherjee told reporters ahead of French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde's visit to India.

Lagarde, one of the few publicly declared candidates in the running for the IMF managing director's post alongside Mexican central bank president Agustin Carstens, is touring key emerging economies such as Brazil, India and China to seek their support for her candidacy.

The vacancy at the helm of the IMF arose when Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned from the post after being charged with sex offences in New York.
