Juppe said the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan and the European members of the group -- France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany -- were firmly in favour of Lagarde.

"Among the eight heads of state and government, plus the president of the European Commission and the president of the European Council who were there, there was unanimous support for Christine Lagarde," Juppe said on Canal+ television.

Lagarde is due to fly to Brazil later on Sunday as part of a campaign to win support for her candidature from emerging economies which have criticised EU officials for suggesting the new head must be a European.

The only other declared candidate is Mexican Central Bank Governor Agustin Carstens.
