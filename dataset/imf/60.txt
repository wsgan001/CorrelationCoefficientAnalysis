South Africa May Nominate IMF Candidate, Gordhan Says

May 31 (Bloomberg) -- South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said the country is still considering whether to nominate a candidate to head the International Monetary Fund in consultation with other developing nations.

The European Union is backing French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde as the next IMF managing director, which has historically gone to a European. Emerging-market countries, which are challenging the status quo, have yet to agree on a candidate to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who stepped down this month to contest sexual-assault charges.

：We are all very aware of the fact that we require consensus among ourselves and we require a consultative process,； Gordhan told reporters in Cape Town today. ：We have until June 10. It・s work in progress. We are talking about a shift from an entitlement to heading certain institutions to a more democratic process.；

While Gordhan・s predecessor, Trevor Manuel, has been named as a possible candidate for the job, he has yet to say that he is willing to accept the position. Gordhan declined to say whether Manuel was being considered as a nominee, saying it was President Jacob Zuma・s prerogative to decide on a candidate.
