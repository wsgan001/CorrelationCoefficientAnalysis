(RTTNews) - French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde is visiting Brazil as part of a campaign to drum up support for her candidature for the IMF chief's post, reports said on Tuesday.

Addressing reporters in the capital Brasilia on Monday, she vowed to back reforms that would provide emerging economies including Brazil a bigger say in the IMF affairs, if she were selected to head the institution.

Lagarde, a widely respected lawyer who once headed a leading American legal firm, is aiming to become the first woman to head the multilateral institution. She also echoed the developing world's view when she said the IMF (International Monetary Fund) chief should not be chosen on the basis of nationality.

"I share with them a few principles, and to begin with I believe, particularly, that the selection process of the new director of the fund must be open, transparent, and based on merit," Lagarde said.

Traditionally though an European has headed the IMF while its economic twin the World Bank (WB) has had an American as its chief. Currently the WB is headed by American Robert Zoellick.

Presently, Mexican central bank chief Agustin Carstens is only other candidate in the running for the top job. Carstens is expected to visit Brazil this week on a similiar trip to enlist support for his candidature.

The top job fell vacant after incumbent Dominique Strauss-Kahn of France was forced to step down on May 18 after being accused of attempted rape of a New York hotel maid.
