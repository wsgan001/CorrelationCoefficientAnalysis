Mexico's Carstens: IMF Should Be Flexible In Aiding Emerging Markets 

BRASILIA (Dow Jones)--The International Monetary Fund should be flexible in offering assistance for emerging-market nations, including recognizing countries' rights to impose capital controls and build foreign reserves in cases where needed, Bank of Mexico President Agustin Carstens said Wednesday.

Carstens made the declarations at a press conference following a meeting with Brazilian officials regarding his candidacy for the position of managing director at the fund.

"It's important that the fund recognize the right, and allow full flexibility, for countries to impose capital controls that they judge convenient," Carstens said. "The same is true for the accumulation of reserves--there is no universal rule that should be applied to all countries."

Carstens said he believed it was important that emerging-market nations and Latin American nations see more representation at the IMF, and added he believed the fund would gain more legitimacy in dealing with current difficulties in Europe if it had a non-European director.

He also said he would back accelerating reforms underway at the IMF if he were chosen for the post.

Carstens, a former deputy managing director at the fund, announced his candidacy for the IMF post last month after former managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn stepped down from the position to defend himself against sexual assault charges.

Carstens is in the running for the position alongside French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde. Lagarde visited with Brazilian authorities on Monday.

Also speaking after Wednesday's meeting, Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega reiterated recent statements that Brazil has not yet chosen its candidate for the post and would make the choice based on merit.

Mantega, however, said it was important that there was a non-European candidate in the running for the job and said Brazil would make its choice based on merit and not on nationality.

Asked be reporters whether he believe his candidacy could get support considering strong backing from developed economies for Lagarde, Carstens said support for him was growing and that he believed most nations would hear out candidates until a June 10 deadline.

"I wouldn't be campaigning if I didn't believe my candidacy was viable," he said.

After his Brazil visit, Carstens plans to take the campaign to other key IMF member nations including Argentina, India, China and Japan.
