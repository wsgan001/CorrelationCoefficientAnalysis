Lagarde to seek support in China, India, Brazil

PARIS ¡X French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said on Sunday she plans to visit India and China and some African countries as well as Brazil to drum up support for her bid to lead the International Monetary Fund.

"I have proposed to Brazil, China, India and certain African countries" to pay them a visit, she told Europe 1 radio, adding that the would travel on Monday to Brazil because it was the first state to respond to her proposal.

Brazilian officials had previously confirmed Lagarde's trip and said that Mexico's central bank governor Agustin Carstens, another leading candidate for the position of IMF managing director, was expected in Brasilia on Wednesday.

The so-called BRICS, the group of emerging economic powers that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, have criticised the Europeans' grip on the IMF, but have not yet agreed on a candidate of their own.

The French finance minister is the favourite to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has been charged with sexual assault in New York, as the head of the organisation.

The IMF is due to publish the full list of candidates seeking to become the next managing director by June 17. The final selection is expected to be announced by June 30.
