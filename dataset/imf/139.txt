Carstens seeks second nomination but Brazil backs Lagarde
MEXICAN central bank governor Agustin Carstens tries for a second endorsement in Brazil to lead the International Monetary Fund 

MEXICAN central bank governor Agustin Carstens tried for a second endorsement in Brazil yesterday to lead the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as Brazil unofficially joined leaders from Europe in backing a rival bid by French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde.

Since being nominated on May 22, Mr Carstens has picked up a single endorsement abroad, from Uruguay. His visit follows one by Ms Lagarde on May 30, when she met Finance Minister Guido Mantega.

A Brazilian official said the following day that the government would privately support Ms Lagarde in the race to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn as MD .

Mr Carstens¡¦s bid was unlikely to succeed but his credentials as a former deputy MD could not be overlooked and may advance his bigger goal of giving emerging markets more say in running the world economy , Guillermo le Fort, a former IMF economist from Chile , said yesterday. "Carstens is making a principled stand," said Mr le Fort, who was a director on the IMF¡¦s board for Chile and five South American nations from 2000 to 2004 .

"If he¡¦s successful in advancing the cause of emerging markets, the Europeans might feel red in the face and decide to hold more ¡K open elections based on merit in the future."

Any of the 187 member nations has until next Friday to nominate candidates . The executive board, which will select a n MD by June 30, is aiming for consensus rather than a majority vote, the fund has said.

The US has largely stayed silent about its preference , as traditionally the European Union decides on the new chief . SA¡¦s Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his Australian counterpart Wayne Swan last week jointly said the new chief should be chosen on performance and not nationality . Bloomberg, Staff Writer
