Lagarde kicks off IMF campaign in Brazil

BRASILIA, May 30 (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde arrived in Brazil on Monday seeking to win support from one of the most influential emerging economies for her bid to the lead the International Monetary Fund.

The backing of Latin America's largest economy, which appears likely, could help turn the tide in favor of Lagarde's candidacy among developing countries and ease discontent over the practice of choosing a European to head the global lender.

Lagarde's visit to Brasilia is the first in a hastily arranged global tour that will take her to India, China, Russia and Saudi Arabia as she competes with Mexican central bank chief Agustin Carstens, the only other declared candidate.

"I'm coming here, obviously, to explain my candidacy ... and I'm also here to listen to what the Brazilian authorities expect from the fund and from the managing director," Lagarde said on her arrival.

The resignation of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who stepped down as the IMF managing director to defend himself against sexual assault charges including attempted rape, has led to calls from developing countries to end the traditional European lock on the job.
