French IMF Candidate Travels to Brazil

French Finance Minister, Christine Largade, visited Brazil on Monday to speak to Guido Mantega, about her International Monetary Fund (IMF) candidacy.

There has been some speculation about candidates running to head the IMF. Many criticize that the head of IMF is always European. Brazilian officials have not yet stated whether they support Largarde's candidacy but have emphasized that the next IMF leader should be chosen on merits and not on geography.

For past years, Mantega has been fighting for reforms to take place in the IMF as well as the World Bank, for them to take into account emerging nations other than Europe, such as India, China and Brazil. "You can have a competent European. but you can have a representative from an emerging nation who is competent as well". There is a lot of tension many nations have with the IMF candidacy.

China's Foreign Ministry also agrees with Brazil to shake things up in the IMF. Largarde plans to travel to China next week to speak more about her candidacy and plans for the IMF. Largade is determined to show that if she is selected to head the IMF it will be because of her merit, not geography.

Former Head of the IMF, Dominique Strauss-Kahn of France, has been accused of sexual assault in New York City. As of May 18 Strauss-Khan quit his position.
