SPAIN TO VOTE FOR MEXICO'S CARSTENS FOR IMF POSITION

Madrid - Spain would like to see Christine Lagarde appointed head of the IMF but will have to vote for Mexico's Augustin Carstens due to the bonds linking Spain to a series of Latin American countries. Minister of the Economy, Elena Salgado said, "We share our seat in the IMF with Venezuela, Mexico and other Latin American countries, so we will have to cast our vote on the basis of our 'invisible' seat." However, "we believe that Lagarde is an excellent candidate and we would like to see her leading the IMF." Carstens is the Governor of the Bank of Mexico. . .
