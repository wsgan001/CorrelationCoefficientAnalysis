IMF candidates Lagarde, Carstens to visit Brazil

BRASILIA -(MarketWatch)- Top candidates for the post of International Monetary Fund managing director, Christine Lagarde and Agustin Carstens, will pay visits to Brazil next week as part of their campaigns for the position, the Brazilian Finance Ministry said Friday.

The ministry said French Finance Minister Lagarde would arrive in the morning Monday to meet with Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega and with officials at Brazil's central bank.

Bank of Mexico Governor Carstens is scheduled to visit Wednesday for similar meetings.

The candidates threw their names in the ring for the IMF position following the departure of former Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who resigned last week to defend himself from sexual assault charges.

Mantega this week said Brazil would be prepared to support a candidate from Europe or from a developing country as long as the candidate backed reforms at the organization and sought to give greater voice to emerging market nations. He also said, however, that Brazil would request a temporary appointment to the post to serve out only the remainder of Strauss-Kahn's term, which was due to end in 2012
