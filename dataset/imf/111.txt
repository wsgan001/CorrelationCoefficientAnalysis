Spain forced to back Carstens' IMF bid


Spain will have to support Mexican candidate Agustin Carstens for the top job at the IMF despite it preferring French finance minister Christine Lagarde for the role.

The seat that Spain holds at the International Monetary Fund is shared with Mexico, Venezuela and four Central American countries which means that it will be forced to back Bank of Mexico governor Carstens' bid for the position of managing director.

Spain's finance minister Elena Salgado said on Tuesday that under the agreement it has with Latin American countries, if one of the nations sharing the seat offers a candidate, the others must vote for that person.

But she said: "The position of Spain is that the French minister is an excellent candidate and it is she whom we would like to see in the post."

Lagarde is emerging as a clear favourite among European countries. 

But Carstens has said he will offer a different view to that of a European in the role and that developed economies could learn lessons from how emerging market economies have weathered the financial crisis.

The IMF post is vacant after former managing director...
