FRANKFURT (MNI) - Europe should not overestimate the International Monetary Fund's role in resolving the current sovereign debt crisis, Bank of Mexico Governor Agustin Carstens said in a commentary published Wednesday in the Financial Times.

Carstens, a candidate to be the IMF's managing director, said that job should be decided on merit, "rather than a backroom deal among a clique of advanced economies to select, inevitably, by a vintage second world war agreement, a European."

Carsten's chief rival for the job is French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, widely viewed as the favorite at this stage, at least in the European media.

The IMF can help Europe by providing objective analysis, "workable solutions" and, when needed, financial assistance, Carstens said. However, the "tough decisions" that are needed to resolve the crisis must be made domestically.

"The IMF cannot make these political decisions for Europe, whether its managing director is European or not," Carstens said.

Carstens stressed the importance of protecting the IMF from national interests or influence.

"Only an objective and apolitical IMF will retain its credibility to serve the international community as the platform of economic co-operation," Carstens said.

"The IMF's 187 members all deserve a candidate who can lead the IMF as what it was originally intended to be: a fully global institution that addresses economic imbalances well before they send any country, or all of them, into another abyss."
