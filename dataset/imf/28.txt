"I have proposed to Brazil, China, India and certain African countries" to pay them a visit, she told Europe 1 radio, adding that the would travel on Monday to Brazil because it was the first state to respond to her proposal.

The so-called BRICS, the group of emerging economic powers that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, have criticised the Europeans' grip on the IMF, but have not yet agreed on a candidate of their own.

The French finance minister is the favourite to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has been charged with sexual assault in New York, as the head of the organisation.

The IMF is due to publish the full list of candidates seeking to become the next managing director by June 17. The final selection is expected to be announced by June 30.
