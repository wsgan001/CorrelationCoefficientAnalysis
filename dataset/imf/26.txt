French finance chief Christine Lagarde is starting a global tour to promote her candidacy to head the International Monetary Fund with a trip to Brazil.

Lagarde posted a message on her Twitter account Sunday: "Flying to Brasilia: tomorrow lunch with my colleague Guido Mantega, meeting with Governor of the Central Bank Alexandre Tombini."

Lagarde launched her bid to lead the IMF last week, a candidacy that would put the first woman in charge of the scandal-rocked fund.

However the move increases tensions with developing nations who argue someone from another region should be given the job this time.

The IMF's last managing director, Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Kahn, quit on May 18 after he was accused of attempting to rape a New York hotel maid.
