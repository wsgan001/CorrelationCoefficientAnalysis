Spain Would Support Carstens For IMF Post Due To Vote Sharing 

MADRID (Dow Jones)-Spain will support Mexico's Agustin Carstens in the race to become the new head of the International Monetary Fund due to a vote sharing agreement with several Latin American countries, finance minister Elena Salgado said Tuesday.

At a press conference in Madrid, Salgado said Spain's support for Carstens was a technical issue. Spain has an agreement to vote in block with Venezuela, Mexico and the Central American countries. If a representative from any of these countries are among the candidates for managing director, all countries in the block are obliged to vote for that candidate.

Carstens, the governor of the Bank of Mexico, is the chief rival to France's Christine Lagarde for the top job.
