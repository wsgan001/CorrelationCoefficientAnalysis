Lagarde in Brazil to promote IMF candidacy

French finance chief Christine Lagarde is kicking off a global tour to promote her candidacy to head the International Monetary Fund with a trip to Brazil.

Lagarde posted a message on her Twitter account Sunday: "Flying to Brasilia: tomorrow lunch with my colleague Guido Mantega, meeting with Governor of the Central Bank Alexandre Tombini."

Lagarde launched her bid to lead the IMF last week, a candidacy that would put the first woman in charge of the scandal-rocked fund but increases tensions with developing nations who argue someone from another region should be given the job this time.

The IMF's last managing director, Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Kahn, quit May 18 after he was accused of attempting to rape a New York hotel maid.
