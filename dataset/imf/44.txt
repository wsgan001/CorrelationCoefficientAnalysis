G8 backs Lagarde bid to head IMF

The leaders of the G8 are backing French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde in her bid to run the IMF, according to her cabinet colleague Alain Juppe.

Mr Juppe said all eight countries supported the appointment of Ms Lagarde to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has quit after he was charged with attempted rape.

"Among the eight heads of state and government, plus the president of the European Commission and the president of the European Council who were there [at last week's G8 summit in Deauville] there was unanimous support for Christine Lagarde," Mr Juppe said.

This comes despite the threat of an inquiry into Ms Lagarde's role in a legal settlement with a French businessman from 2008.
