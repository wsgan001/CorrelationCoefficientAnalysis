Countries Hoping for a Non-European IMF Leader

France¡¦s Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde seems to be leading the race for the next leader for the IMF. Other countries do not seem too please about this and would rather see a non-European in that position.
Lagarde¡¦s competitor, Agustin Carstens, who has headed Mexico¡¦s Central Bank since the beginning of 2010 states: ¡§I dare say that it might be more appropriate to have a non-European because a new set of eyes can look at Europe¡¦s problems more objectively¡¨.

Critics towards Europe¡¦s tradition are stating that candidates should be picked based on merit and not their geography. It seems that the leader of the IMF is always European. The IMF is providing objective analysis that provides ¡§working solutions¡¨ for Europe.

Carstens is considered if Lagarde is chosen for the IMF position and states: ¡§The IMF¡¦s 187 members all deserve a candidate who can lead the IMF¡Ka fully global institution that addresses economic imbalances¡¨.

Europe¡¦s current situation does not lot so good either. Countries are experience an economic nightmare, especially Greece. As well, their past leader of the IMF is dealing with allegations due to sexual harassment.
