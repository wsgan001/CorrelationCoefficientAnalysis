Lagarde Is ．At Ease・ on Investigation, Plans IMF Campaign Visits

Christine Lagarde, French finance minister and a candidate to head the International Monetary Fund, said her conscience is ：at ease； awaiting a court・s decision on whether to investigate her for abuse of power.

Lagarde, speaking on Europe 1 radio today, defended her decision to arbitrate a dispute with Bernard Tapie, a supporter of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and not to appeal the panel・s 385 million-euro ($551 million) award to Tapie, saying it was in the state・s interest to end the 15-year-old dispute.

When she arrived at the Finance Ministry, Lagarde studied the most recent decision in the Tapie file by France・s highest appeals court, concluding the state faced ：a potential risk of as much as 7 billion euros,； she told Europe 1. She said she saw three options: go back to court, negotiate a settlement or enter arbitration, which she chose ：so that we could close it in the least negative way for the state.；

Lagarde also criticized the prosecution report recommending the court overseeing ministers・ conduct in office investigate the matter, saying that when it said she decided to arbitrate the affair, she was Minister of Agriculture.

The IMF plans to pick a new head by the end of June. Lagarde will fly to Brazil tonight for a one-day visit to bolster support for her candidacy. Brazil was ：the first to tell me to come； of the countries she contacted, she told Europe 1. She contacted ：certain African countries,； China and India as well, and said she will probably visit the Middle East.
