Lagarde says she will ensure that the fund represents the diversity of all members.

Christine Lagarde, France's finance minister, who is the front-runner to become the next head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is promising reforms to the organisation as she strives to win support for her candidacy.

Lagarde, who arrived in Brazil on Monday (30 May) as part of a visit to developing countries, will have talks in China, India, Russia and Saudi Arabia this week.

Mindful of the criticism that, as a European, she would not properly represent emerging economies, Lagarde is seeking to portray herself as a reformer who would serve the interests of all countries. She told reporters in Brazil that she would ¡§ensure that the fund represents the diversity of all members¡¨. Since the IMF was created at the end of the Second World War, its managing director has always been European.

Also visiting Brazil this week will be Augustin Carstens, the governor of Mexico's central bank and the only other person to have declared an interest in the IMF job. Guido Mantega, Brazil's finance minister, said his country had yet to decide which candidate to back.

Carstens, who visited Spain on Monday, said that he disagreed with the contention that a European should lead the IMF because of the eurozone sovereign-debt crisis. ¡§The Europeans are wrong to think only a European can help them out of their crisis,¡¨ he said.

The IMF executive board will draw up a shortlist of a maximum of three candidates to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who resigned on 18 May after accusations of a sexual assault in New York, which he denies. The deadline for nominations is 10 June, with an appointment to be made by 30 June.
