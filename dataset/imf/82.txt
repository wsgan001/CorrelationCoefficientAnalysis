France's Lagarde Pledges To Give Emerging Economies More IMF Power

BRASILIA (Raymond Colitt) - French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde pledged to push reforms to give Brazil and other emerging economies more influence at the International Monetary Fund as she kicked off a worldwide tour on Monday to win support for her candidacy to lead the global lender.

The backing of Brazil, Latin America's largest economy and an influential diplomatic power, could help ease discontent among developing countries over the long-standing practice of choosing a European to head the Washington-based IMF.

Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said Brazil had yet to decide whether to support Lagarde or her only declared rival, Mexican central bank chief Agustin Carstens. But he underscored the need for more reforms to give emerging economies a greater voice in the IMF, something Lagarde was eager to stress she supported.

Lagarde's comments came as Carstens kicked off his own tour to campaign for the job, starting in Spain where he urged IMF members not to elect a European by default.

Brazilian officials said in private before Lagarde's visit that President Dilma Rousseff is inclined to back her candidacy as long as she pledges to continue reforming the IMF. They see Lagarde as having more clout to push reforms than Carstens, who arrives in Brazil on Wednesday.

"If I was elected, I'd make sure that the diversity of members is represented at all levels," Lagarde told reporters at a news conference in Brazil's capital, Brasilia.
