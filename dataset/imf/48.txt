Johannesburg - South Africa's Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan criticised the decision by wealthy countries to back French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde for the top job at the International Monetary Fund.

Lagarde won the support of the Group of Eight (G8) industrialised nations, who met last week, but Gordhan said the backing was contrary to agreements within the wider G20, which includes emerging markets.

'Within the G20 there are countries that have agreed on a process that would be very different from the historical process, and a process that is based on transparency openness on merit, a process that will ignore nationality,' Gordhan said, according to broadcaster SABC.

Historically, the top IMF position is held by a European, while its sister organisation, the World Bank, is led by a US-citizen.

India and China are also key emerging markets pushing for reform at the top of international institutions. However, the two big Asian powers have indicated they may accept the status quo for the next IMF appointment.

One of the candidates developing nations were touting for the IMF job was Trevor Manuel, the former South African finance minister.

Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, also a French national, resigned from his post this month after being charged with attempted rape.
