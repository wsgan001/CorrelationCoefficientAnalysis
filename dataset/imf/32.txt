France's Lagarde promotes her IMF candidacy in Brazil

Brasilia - French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde arrived Monday in Brazil on an international tour to promote her candidacy for the position of managing director of the IMF.

Lagarde hopes to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn, another French former finance minister, who resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund earlier this month after being charged with sexual assault on a housekeeper at a New York hotel.

Lagarde met with Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega and Central Bank President Alexandre Tombini.

She committed herself to continuing Strauss-Kahn's IMF governance reform, which were intended among other things to give more power within the crisis lender to emerging countries.

Lagarde stressed that she has a global vision for the IMF. Her tour is to take her to other emerging countries including China, India and the Middle East.

Mantega was pleased that Lagarde chose Brazil as the starting point of her tour, and he praised her candidacy. However, he noted that the so-called BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) have not yet decided on a consensus candidate.

'We are worried about the future of the IMF,' he said. 'The important thing is that the new managing director makes a commitment to new reforms.'

He said Brazil wants a strong IMF, in which emerging economies have greater power. The South American giant plans to meet with all the candidates before making a decision on who to back.

Lagarde is currently the favourite in the race for the top position in the IMF. Mexican Central Bank President Agustin Carstens is also expected to be a candidate.
