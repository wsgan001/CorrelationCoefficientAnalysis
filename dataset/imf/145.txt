IMF needs voice of emerging countries: Mexican central banker

BUENOS AIRES, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexican central bank governor Agustin Carstens said here Friday that his bid for the top post at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is aimed at letting the voice of emerging countries be heard at the world body.

"The main incentive for my nomination is to let the voice of emerging countries be heard at the IMF so that the institution grows more plural and open," he said after meeting with President Mercedes Marco del Pont of the Central Bank of Argentina and Economy Minister Amado Boudou.

"Nowadays, the global economy is growing thanks to the impetus of emerging countries, and the IMF has to accept that," he added.

The Mexican central banker, who arrived here Friday from Brazil, is touring Latin America to seek support for his race to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who stepped down as managing director of the IMF in May after having been charged with sexual assault on a hotel maid in New York.

The Washington-based IMF has set a June 30 deadline to determine the new directorship, which has been held by a European since 1945. Among other competitors is French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde.

The election process has to be "fair and transparent" and based on "merits and abilities," said Carstens.

Argentina has not announced any official decision on whom to support.

Days ago, Boudou said that "it's important that the appointed one be from an emerging country."
