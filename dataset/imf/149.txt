International Monetary Fund Searches for New Leader

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is searching for a new managing director in the wake of its former leader's indictment on charges of rape, according to the Manila Bulletin.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned from the post on May 19th and is still awaiting trial. In the meantime, a frontrunner to replace him has emerged in Christine Lagarde, France's finance minister. Ms. Lagarde is well-respected in European circles and has already drawn support from France, Britain, and Italy. Having lived in the US for 25 years and headed a law firm in Chicago, she also maintains a positive reputation in American circles.

Outside of Europe, however, several countries are voicing opposition to the possible choice of another European for the post. The Bulletin writes that nations such as Australia and South Africa object to the IMF's always being headed by a European, similar to the World Bank's always having an American director.

Other candidates include Agustin Carstens, central bank governor of Mexico. A number of editorials in newspapers worldwide have endorsed his possible candidacy as a viable solution to the problem of the European hegemony at the IMF. Others who have been mentioned as possible candidates include India's deputy chairman of planning, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, and Africa's finance minister, Trevor Manuel.

The IMF has set a deadline of June 30th for the selection of a new director.
