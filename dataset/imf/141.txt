Brazil Plans To Support Lagarde For IMF Post -Report

SAO PAULO -(Dow Jones)- The Brazilian government intends to support France's Christine Lagarde in the race to become the new head of the International Monetary Fund, local financial newspaper Valor Economico reported in its Wednesday edition.

According to the newspaper, which did not reveal its sources, the Brazilian government decided to support Lagarde because she proposed to give more room for Brazil on the technical structure at the IMF.

Contacted by Dow Jones Newswires earlier Wednesday, government officials were not immediately available for comment.

Earlier this week, Lagarde, who is also the French Finance Minister, said the IMF could speed up a rebalancing of member-nation representation if she is elected to its top post.

Speaking after meetings with Brazilian Finance authorities on her candidacy for the position, Lagarde said if elected, she could seek to carry out planned changes in the organization's governance to meet recent demands from key emerging-market members.

The only official rival of Lagarde for the IMF post so far, is Mexico's Agustin Carstens, the governor of the Central Bank of Mexico.
