Denver cruises, even Western finals

Denver - ¡X The Denver Nuggets are so much more than just Carmelo Anthony.

A dominating effort on the boards and a great performance by the bench helped the Nuggets overcome a below-par effort from an ailing 'Melo on Monday night, when they raced past the Los Angeles Lakers 120-101 to even the Western Conference finals at two games apiece.

They did it with Anthony hobbled by a sprained ankle and slowed by a stomach virus that had him hugging the commode before tip-off and getting IVs at halftime.

"Even before I twisted my ankle, with my stomach, I didn't have my legs early in the game," Anthony said. "I felt like I didn't have any energy. Those IVs were a must. They helped a little bit. I'll be OK for Wednesday."
