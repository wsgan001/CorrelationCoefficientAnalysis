A day later, the NBA blew the whistle on Dahntay Jones for tripping Kobe Bryant.

The league assessed Denver's defensive specialists a flagrant-1 foul for sending the Lakers' star sprawling through the lane with a trip late in the third quarter that Bennett Salvatore's officiating crew missed.

Los Angeles coach Phil Jackson complained about Jones' "unacceptable defense, tripping guys and playing unsportsmanlike basketball" during a rant about the officiating.

Jackson's rip on Jones came after Los Angeles fell 120-101 to Denver to tie the Western Conference finals at 2.
