The 5/21 edition of TNA Impact did a 1.1 cable rating.

The 5/21 edition of WWE Superstars on WGN dropped to a 0.8 cable rating.  The 11 p.m. replay did a 0.2 cable rating.

On last night's edition of Raw, WWE had the following "Did You Know" mastur-ba-graphic:

"Last Monday, Raw was once again the #1 show on cable TV - beating its nearest competition by over 1 million viewers".

I got some emails from readers asking if that were true, since the NBA playoffs have been doing so well in recent weeks.  In this case, WWE was telling the truth but there was a mitigating circumstance.  They averaged 5.1 million viewers and the next closest show, NCIS which preceded them on USA at 8 p.m., did 3.9 million viewers.  However, they lucked out and didn't have to go against the NBA last Monday so it made their feat a bit easier to accomplish.  On Tuesday 5/19, The Denver Nuggets-LA Lakers game did a 5.8 cable rating and over 8 million viewers.  The Cleveland Cavaliers-Orlando Magic game on Wednesday 5/20 did a 5.3 cable rating and 7.3 million viewers.  When they went head-to-head with the NBA two weeks ago, the Nuggets-Dallas Mavericks Western Conference Semifinal game was the highest rated program of the evening.  So, next week don't expect to hear that WWE beat last night's Nuggets-Lakers' game by a million viewers.  In fact, WWE probably will not beat the NBA, period.
