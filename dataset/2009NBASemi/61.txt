Knapp: Magic's Howard has legitimate point

Dwight Howard is right. Everyone foresaw Kobe and LeBron in the NBA Finals and expected Howard and Carmelo Anthony to wait their turn. We apologize profusely.

Let's also apologize in advance for the Finals, because if it comes down to Orlando and Denver, the whines will be deafening. Is that unfair? Yes. Is it silly? Of course.

The Magic's 3-1 lead over the Cavs is no fluke. Orlando plays better and smarter than the Cavaliers. Howard borders on a revelation, gaining more and more of the type of star quality that makes people hanker for that showdown between LeBron James and Kobe Bryant. Howard's blocked shot on James near the end of Game 4 was the work of a champion-in-waiting, a stunning show of force and composure at a critical moment.
