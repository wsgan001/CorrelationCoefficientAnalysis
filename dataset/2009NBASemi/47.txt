With athleticism, energy, and determination, the Denver Nuggets evened up their series up with a 120-101 win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night.

Along with J.R. Smith・s 24 points off the bench, the Nuggets・ front court athleticism were the story of the game as Denver・s big men completely overwhelmed the Laker frontcourt.

With 6-11 Nene (Brazil) and 6-8 Linas Kleiza (Lithuania) bruising down low, Chris ：Birdman； Andersen, Kenyon Martin, and Carmelo Anthony attacked the offensive boards with ferocity and athleticism that left the Lakers・ big men, Pau Gasol and Andrew Bynum, flat-footed and dazed.

The Nuggets grabbed 20 offensive rebounds, and out rebounded the Lakers 58-40. Several times throughout the game, Andersen, Nene, and Martin were seen crashing around the basket, grabbing rebounds, causing chaos, and giving the Nuggets second and third chances.

：It was bad,； Kobe Bryant said. ：They kept getting second-chance opportunities and making us pay for them. They did a great job on the boards.；

Nene finally snapped out of his funk with 14 points, 13 rebounds, and a game-high 6 assists; recording his first double-double since the opening game of the playoffs. He also recorded a game-high seven offensive rebounds, and that・s not counting the few times that he tapped the ball out.

Kenyon Martin also had 15 rebounds, while Chris Andersen had 14 rebounds off the bench.

Nene・s 13 rebounds is his second-highest total in the 2009 NBA playoffs.  He recorded 14 rebounds in Denver・s first playoff game vs. the New Orleans Hornets.

With the series tied at two apiece, game five of the Western Conference Finals is Wednesday, May 27th at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.
