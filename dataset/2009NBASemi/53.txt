Gasol says Lakers should go inside

Pau Gasol wants the ball inside against the Denver Nuggets. Only he's not about to pull a Keyshawn Johnson and order his Los Angeles Lakers teammates to "just give me the damn ball." That's not the Spaniard's way.

"I just want to go with what's effective and what works out there and what's been working for us and what's a strength of ours," he said after Tuesday's practice in Los Angeles ahead of tonight's Game 5 of the Western Conference finals. "I think we should explore that a little more. I wish we would take more advantage of our height and inside game because it's pretty effective."
