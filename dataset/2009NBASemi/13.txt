Orlando Hands Cleveland First NBA Post-Season Loss 107-106 

May 21 (Bloomberg) -- The Orlando Magic handed the Cleveland Cavaliers their first post-season loss of the 2009 National Basketball Association playoffs in the opening game of the Eastern Conference finals.

Rashard Lewis, who had 22 points for the Magic, hit a 3- pointer with 14.7 seconds remaining to silence the crowd at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland and lift Orlando to a 107-106 win in the best-of-seven series.

The Magic trailed by 16 points 30 seconds into the second quarter and by 63-48 at the half before outscoring the Cavaliers 59-43 in the second half. Orlando trailed until 10 minutes from the end, when Anthony Johnson made a 24-foot 3-pointer to put the Magic ahead 85-84.

¡§This is a resilient basketball team,¡¨ Magic Coach Stan Van Gundy said in a television interview. ¡§We¡¦ll keep fighting.¡¨

Cleveland didn¡¦t regain the lead until Delonte West made a 3-pointer with 40 seconds remaining. Trailing 104-105 with 25 seconds left, LeBron James drew a foul as he made an 8-foot jump shot and converted the free throw to put the Cavaliers 106-104 ahead. Lewis then made the final basket, from 25 feet, to seal the win.

¡§We have to play 48 minutes; we only played the second half,¡¨ said Lewis. ¡§We can¡¦t come out here and let them hit us first.¡¨

Dwight Howard scored 30 points and grabbed 13 rebounds for Orlando.

James scored 49 points, a career-best tally in a playoff game, while Mo Williams added 17 points for the Cavaliers. Cleveland, which had an NBA-best 66-16 record during the regular season, swept the first two playoff rounds against Atlanta and Detroit to become the first team to start the postseason 8-0 since the Miami Heat in 2005.

The series continues tomorrow in Cleveland.
