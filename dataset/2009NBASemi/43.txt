Pau Gasol is tall, really tall. In fact, he is seven feet tall and weighs around 250 pounds. One would think that in the game of basketball, where size is certainly the most noted advantage a player can have, the Lakers would like to get him the ball when the game is close and the Lakers have the ability to take a 3-1 advantage over the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals.

One would think.

But thinking never got anyone anything. At least, I think that・s how the saying goes, but I do know who thinks the way I do, and that is Pau Gasol.

Gasol has done pretty well from the field so far in the playoffs, sinking 56 percent of his field goals and averaging just below his season average in points at 18.3 per game. Monday night Gasol tried only 11 shots (Kobe Bryant took 26) of which he made eight. Gasol shot 72 percent from the field while the rest of Lakers shot a sarcastically impressive 36 percent.

So it would make sense that instead of shooting 31 3-point shots, like they did last night, the Lakers might want to send the ball inside and let Gasol get nasty in the paint. He is having his best games of the post-season against the Nuggets, making 62 percent of his shots, and Denver doesn・t have a tall order defender who can keep him from dropping it in the hole, so why not get him the ball more?

I don．t know, but I can guess.

Maybe the Lakers are too dependent on Kobe Bryant to think about spreading the ball around inside. Maybe the Nuggets said that if Gasol makes too many they were going to start sending some hard fouls his way. Maybe the moons of Jupiter shifted and Gasol is no longer the player that helped the Lakers to the best record in the NBA and an appearance in the finals last season.

Maybe.

Or maybe it was an error in coaching, and I・m not the only one that thinks so.

．"I wish we would take more advantage of our height and the inside game, because it's pretty effective. It's unfortunate that we don't recognize it enough," Gasol said in report by the Los Angeles Daily News. ：I feel like we have an advantage, and I'm effective, we should stay with what works and what's effective and not get away from it. It just doesn't make a lot of sense."

No it doesn・t. We all know Kobe can pile the rest of his team into a backpack like a dozen clowns into a little car, shoulder the weight and carry his team to a victory, but it would be nice, and beneficial to the Lakers, to get the ball to the big center who is almost a guarantee to get the bucket, the foul or at least a second chance.

When asked if there was a specific reason as to why Gasol didn・t get the ball more, head coach Phil Jackson said in his post-game press conference, ：No. You can ask him when he comes in about it.；

So I guess it was Pau・s fault for not passing to himself more?

Jackson went on to say the ball movement and the Denver defense could have attributed to the lack of Gasol possessions. Maybe we didn・t notice Gasol in the buckle down time of the fourth quarter because the Nuggets were so great playing ・D・, or maybe because he wasn・t in the game, and when he was, he didn・t get the ball enough.

Gasol・s first stat in the fourth quarter was a rebound with 4:45 left in the game. Kobe or not, your team won・t win when the second best player has his first and last points of the fourth quarter come from free throws with four minutes remaining.

By the time he got in the game, L.A. was down 13 points with just over six minutes left. The Lakers then turned to Kobe and said, ：Please get us out of this great one.； He didn・t and the Lakers lost 120-101.

Now the series heads back to La La Land with the Lakers tied 2-2 with the Nuggets. Now, being at home where calls will lean toward the Lakers, it would be a huge mistake for Jackson not to demand the ball to be in Gasol・s hands more.

Kobe Bryant aka Black Mamba will carry his team, and L.A. is a team that is structured to let him. But if the Lakers want to beat the Nuggets (who can out-rebound, out-score and out-hustle them, which they did Monday) they will need to let Gasol be like a pair of old gym socks in a bucket of Sherwin Williams--filthy in the paint.

Otherwise why did they trade for him?
