1. It ain¡¦t over til it¡¦s over, but if the Wine and Gold intend to salvage their dream season, they¡¦re going to have to win three straight to do it.

The mystique of the Magic Kingdom continues for Cleveland, as they have now dropped all four games in Orlando this season. The first two hurt losses hurt, the last two ¡V including Tuesday night¡¦s painful 116-114 overtime defeat ¡V have been devastating.

LeBron James sank two free throws with less than a second remaining in regulation to tie Game 4 at 100-apiece. But Dwight Howard was almost unstoppable in the extra session, scoring Orlando¡¦s first six points of the five-minute period.

The Cavaliers tried to mount one more comeback, with LeBron James splashing home a three-pointer with 4.6 seconds remaining in OT. But Rashard Lewis was money from the stripe and sent Cleveland to the showers, trailing the seven-game Eastern Conference Finals, 3-1.

LeBron continued his tear through the third round of the postseason, adding 44 points to his already-brilliant body of work. James went 13-for-29 from the floor and 14-of-18 from the stripe. The league¡¦s MVP grabbed a team-high 12 rebounds and equaled Delonte West with seven assists. On the negative side of the ledger, LeBron also led both clubs with eight turnovers.

"We've got to close out games right away," lamented James. "We're giving ourselves a chance, and we're breaking down in areas that we haven't broke down all year."

The Cavaliers fell behind early again in Game 4, but used an 11-0 run in the first quarter and scored on their last ten possessions of the second to take an eight-point lead into intermission.

But Rafer Alston caught fire in the third quarter, notching 15 of his career-high 26 points as the Magic got within one heading into the fourth.

The Magic built their lead to eight with just under eight minutes to play in regulation. Again, the Cavaliers clawed back ¡V taking a one-point lead when LeBron split a pair of three throws with just over a minute to play. Rashard Lewis canned a three-pointer with 4.1 to play to give Orlando the two-point edge, but No. 23¡¦s canned both free throw attempts to send the game to overtime.

The Cavaliers got nice production from their backcourt in Game 4 ¡V with Delonte West notching 17 points and seven helpers and Mo Williams ¡V stitches and all ¡V added 18 points, five boards and a pair of steals. Mo did, however, continue to struggle from the floor ¡V going just 5-for-15, including 0-for-3 from long-distance.

"I thought we had a lot of guys step up and play big minutes for us and contribute that haven't played a ton this series," said Coach Mike Brown. "But our focus right now is Game 5. It's one game, Game 5, and we're looking forward to playing back at home."

The Wine and Gold¡¦s season is officially on the line this Thursday, as it¡¦s do-or-die in Game 5 at The Q.

2. With Tuesday night¡¦s loss, the Cavaliers lost their second game in a row for only the third time all season, but they still have NBA¡¦s best mark following a loss at 15-3 (.833) following a loss.

3. LeBron James has now scored at least 25 points in 15 straight postseason games ¡V (dating back to last postseason) ¡V easily surpassing 13-game streaks by Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O¡¦Neal in 2002-03. The last player with a 14-game streak was Michael Jordan in 1992-93.

4. With the series coming to a slow boil, the war of words has truly begun to heat up. After Magic coach Stan Van Gundy compared Mo Williams and Ben Wallace to newborns falling down ¡V and Ben¡¦s ¡§colorful¡¨ response, LeBron weighed in on Big Ben¡¦s behalf.

¡§You guys know how Stan is,¡¨ said LeBron. ¡§There¡¦s a first time for everything. We all know Ben Wallace has never been a flopper and will never be a flopper. And if you think he¡¦s a flopper, I bet you won¡¦t tell him to his face he¡¦s a flopper. I know damn sure you won¡¦t do that.¡¨

5. War of Words, Part II: With the remarks flying back and forth from both squads, Mike Brown was asked if he intends to issue some kind of ¡§gag order.¡¨

¡§The Ben one is tough,¡¨ replied Coach Brown. ¡§I don¡¦t know if I heard it right. (He got compared to an infant walking?) When you do that to anyone who has a lot of pride ¡V a guy like Ben ¡K I¡¦m not going to say anything to Ben. There¡¦s no gag order; these guys are grown men. And for me to treat them like kids ¡V I won¡¦t do that.¡¨

6. On hand for Tuesday¡¦s Game 4 in Orlando were NBA stars, Shaquillle O¡¦Neal, Vince Carter and Carlos Boozer ¡V though not seated together. From the world of entertainment, actor Chris Tucker.

7. Only eight NBA teams have come back to win a series after being down 3-1. The last team to do it was the Phoenix Suns against the Los Angeles Lakers in 2006. The odds state that the Cavaliers have 12.5 percent chance of winning the series.

8. Guard Daniel Gibson got easily his best run of the 2009 postseason ¡V just over 21 minutes ¡V and contributed with a pair of clutch first-half three-pointers as well as some stubborn defense on Orlando¡¦s Anthony Johnson. Gibson was on the floor for the entire overtime session and finished the game with eight points on 2-for-5 shooting.

9. Statistically speaking, the Cavaliers out-did the Magic in fastbreak points (22-11) and points in the paint (50-36). But the Magic shot an even 50 percent from the floor, including 45 percent from beyond the arc. Orlando shot 70 percent from the stripe; Cleveland, 83 percent.

10. Through the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals, LeBron is averaging 42.2 points per contest. In 58 career postseason games, the young King has tallied 29.3 ppg ¡V surpassing Jerry West for the third-highest playoff average of all-time.
