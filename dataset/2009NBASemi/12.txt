The Cavaliers and LeBron James, it turns out, are human after all.

The Cavs got more than they could handle from the Orlando Magic in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. As expected, the Magic provided a demanding test because of their star center, their deep and talented roster and some incredible outside shooting.

What wasn't expected was what happened to the Cavs when the heat turned up - they melted and broke down. And so did their home-court advantage.

Showing the same poise and execution they displayed in Boston over the weekend, the Magic slayed the Cavs, 107-106, to score a huge first blow.

So the Cavs' eight-game playoff win streak is over and so is their air of invincibility against a team whose confidence is continuing to grow.

"We fought really hard and that's what we're going to continue to do," Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. "There's no easy answers for them."

The final difference on the scoreboard turned out to be a clutch Rashard Lewis 3-pointer over the fingertips of Anderson Varejao with 14.7 seconds left. It was one of two massive baskets Lewis made in the game's final 31 seconds and the exact reason the Magic are so dangerous no matter what building they play in.

Down just one, the Cavs ended up finishing the game with two 3-pointers that missed, one from Mo Williams and one from Delonte West. The inability to get a better shot or James a look personified how the game went.

Those buckets ruined what could have been remembered as James' greatest playoff game to this point.

As it was, he nearly created one of those highlights - that would have been shown for ages - with a miracle shot with 25 seconds left. But his career playoff high of 49 points, believe it or not, was not enough....
