Cleveland Cavaliers fall flat against Orlando Magic in first big road test of the 2009 NBA playoffs: The Plain Dealer's Terry Pluto
Monday, May 25, 2009

Orlando, Fla.- Can the Cavs win a game on the road - especially an ugly, sometimes turnover-scarred, foul-marred mess of a test away from home?

That's what it will take if they are to reach the NBA Finals.

Well, Game 3 was Sunday in Orlando, and here's the verdict: Not yet.

This 99-89 loss to the Magic put the Cavs down, 2-1, in this best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals. It's no reason to write the obituary for this season. They can win here Tuesday, and suddenly this becomes a three-game series with the Cavs regaining home-court advantage.

But they have to do more than say Dwight Howard (24 points) probably won't be 14-of-19 from the foul line again, not when he's usually a 60 percent shooter. Or they can say that they won't have a game where Anderson Varejao and Zydrunas Ilgauskas both foul out. Or when Orlando will go to the free-throw line a stunning 51 times, good for 39 points.

The Cavs can control the fact that they had 15 turnovers that were transformed like magic into 21 Orlando points. The disturbing part is Delonte West had four turnovers and Mo Williams had five. Both usually are reliable ballhandlers, but they didn't show it this night.

Varejao was not his usual active, cutting-to-the-basket self. Instead, he seemed intent on trying to annoy Howard, and it took the Cavs power forward out of his own game. He fouled out after 20 minutes, scoring only four points and grabbing four rebounds.

Ilgauskas was not much better, with nine points on 3-of-10 shooting. He also fouled out. He is one of the best outside shooters among big men in the NBA. But in the playoffs, Ilgauskas is 2-of-13 on 3-pointers. Hey, Z, how about taking a step or two inside the 3-point line? In the Atlanta series, Ilgauskas was 13-of-34 shooting (38 percent), averaging 10.3 points....
