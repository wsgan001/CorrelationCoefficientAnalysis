The Cavaliers made several statements Thursday night, but the most important might have been the one they made to themselves.

They can beat the Orlando Magic, a concept that has seemed doubtful at times during this rocky Eastern Conference finals. And they can do it playing their own way, even if it means having to absorb body blows and intense and sometimes unrelenting pressure.

The Cavs took what they hope is their first step in a comeback by outbattling the Magic, 112-102, in Game 5 at The Q.

It was a high-scoring game that saw the Cavs turn an early 22-point lead into an eight-point deficit with stunning swiftness, not your typical Cavs' effort. But it also showed just what it is going to take to eliminate the Cavs from the playoffs -- quite a bit.

Now the series shifts back to Orlando, Fla., as the Magic gets its second chance for a closeout game. But Orlando will have to do so under pressure for the first time this series.

If the Cavs are to steal one in Florida, it probably will take the same effort they put forth in Game 5. Not only was it the deepest performance of the five games, but it also saw some of the Magic's unsungs stop playing like such heroes.

That, and yet another superior effort from LeBron James, who doesn't yet seem to be tiring of them.

James had his best all-around game of the series and his first triple double of the postseason when the Cavs had to have it.

He scored 37 points with 12 assists and set a career playoff high with 14 rebounds. Those numbers can seem numbing without this context: From late in the third quarter to late in the fourth, James scored or assisted on 32 consecutive Cavs points....
