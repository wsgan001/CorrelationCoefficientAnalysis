Main opposition party kicks off nationwide primary

SEOUL, Aug. 25 (Yonhap) -- With the presidential election four months away, the main opposition Democratic United Party (UDP) is set to kick off its primary race Saturday, starting in the southern island-province of Jeju.

   Some 36,000 party and citizen delegates have registered to vote either through mobile phones or in polling stations during the Jeju primary set to open at 5 p.m., party officials said.

   The winner of the Jeju primary is scheduled to be announced a few hours later.


Four candidates -- former presidential chief of staff Moon Jae-in, former Trade Minister Chung Sye-kyun, former DUP chief Sohn Hak-kyu and former Gyeongnam Province Gov. Kim Doo-kwan -- are vying for the DUP ticket to stand against Rep. Park Geun-hye of the ruling Saenuri Party in the Dec. 19 election.

   South Jeolla Province Governor Park Jun-young has resigned, reducing the DUP candidate count to four.

   Moon is widely seen as a serious opposition contender to Park, a front-runner in opinion polls for the December 19 election.

   Recent polls, however, showed that Moon was behind Park and Ahn Cheol-soo, a popular software entrepreneur-turned-professor who has not yet announced his presidential bid.

   After Jeju, the DUP will also hold primaries in major cities and provinces, including Ulsan and Gangwon Province.

   The party is to designate its presidential nominee on Sept. 16, but a runoff will be held on Sept. 23 if none of the five contenders win a majority of the primary votes.

   The DUP lost the presidential election in 2007 after a decade of liberal rule in South Korea.

   South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's single five-year term ends in February and by law, he cannot seek re-election.
