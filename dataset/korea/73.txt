Ruling party picks presidential election camp officials

SEOUL, Aug. 27 (Yonhap) -- The ruling Saenuri Party on Monday picked senior officials who will take charge of Rep. Park Geun-hye's presidential election campaign.

   Suh Byung-soo, the party's secretary general, said Rep Lee Ju-young, a four-term lawmaker, has been tapped to head the campaign planning committee.

He also said that Kim Chong-in, an economist-turned-politician, who co-chaired Park's primary election campaign support group, has been named as head of the so-called public happiness support committee, while former Supreme Court Justice Ahn Dai-hee will head the political reform committee.

   The happiness committee will be charged with setting up policies that aim to push forward economic democratization, welfare and job creation, while the political reform committee has been tasked to tackle corruption and other injustices that have hurt public confidence in their leaders.

   Saenuri also said that Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan has been made Park's chief of staff.

   Park won the party's primary election last Monday making her the first woman in South Korea's history to be named as a presidential candidate for a major political party.

   South Koreans will go to the polls on Dec. 19 to pick their next president, who will take office in February 2013.
