In response to demands by prominent civil society figures to run for the December 2012 presidential election, a close aide of Ahn Cheol-soo said on August 24 that he ¡§will fully consider their demand and suggestion in the process of making his decision to enter the presidential race.¡¨
In addition to calling for Ahn to run in the presidential race, the senior civic leaders who included Seoul National University emeritus professor Paik Nak-chung also asked that Ahn get ready to work with the opposition to nominate a unified opposition candidate. Keum Tae-seop, a lawyer working closely with Ahn, said in a radio interview with Pyeonghwa Radio that if Ahn were to run for the presidency, ¡§he will fully study the direction he will lean toward in the process of making the decision.¡¨
There are questions on whether Ahn will make his decision in a way he did with Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon: during the mayoral race, the two men worked on a united candidacy. Keum responded that once the decision to run is made, ¡§because this is something that he cannot do alone, there will be discussions on how this will be achieved.¡¨
He added that it is too early to say what kind of method will be used or with whom Ahn will join forces when he hasn¡¦t even decided whether he¡¦ll be running or not. When asked when this decision will be made, the lawyer responded that it is not appropriate to talk about a specific date, ¡§when a certain state of a decision is reached, the public will know about this and when there is a consensus on why this decision was made, everyone will know that it was the right decision.¡¨
Concerning recent buzz over rumors that Ahn drank in hostess bars, Keum defended his friend saying that Ahn had clearly said on television that he used to drink extensively but that he did not anymore. But the rumor about Ahn having a wild drinking session with an executive of a big company is not true, and this can be easily proven.
Meanwhile, lawmaker Kim Jae-won of the New Frontier Party said in an interview with the same radio station that the truth of the matter must be explained by Ahn himself.
