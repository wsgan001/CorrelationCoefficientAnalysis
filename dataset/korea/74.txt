DUP Presidential Primary Back On Schedule

The Democratic United Party will hold its third presidential primary in Gangwon Province on Tuesday, as originally planned.
Three of the party's four presidential contenders, Kim Doo-kwan, Sohn Hak-kyu and Chung Sye-kyun, earlier refused to take part in the primary after the first one on Jeju Saturday, saying the rules for mobile voting gave Representative Moon Jae-in an unfair advantage.
In the previous primaries, mobile votes were NOT counted if the voter hung up before the automated message listing the names of the four candidates was over, and Moon was last on the list.
But after the DUP's election committee confirmed that the number of invalid mobile votes from the Jeju primary, was within the margin of error, the three candidates, although not fully satisfied, decided to return to the race.
The committee has also decided to count the mobile votes from voters that hang up before the entire message is played, and rotate the candidates' order on the list in the upcoming primaries.
Moon is currently leading the race with around 17-thousand votes while Sohn is in second place with nearly 6-thousand votes.
Meanwhile, the ruling Saenuri Party's presidential election planning committee held its first official meeting Tuesday.
During the meeting, the committee discussed ways to effectively draw up campaign strategies and policy pledges for the party's presidential nominee Park Geun-hye.
As for Park, she continued her so-called unity tour by visiting the Chun Tae-il Memorial Foundation to pay tribute to the late labor activist.
Chun burned himself to death in 1970 to protest at bad working conditions, providing momentum for future Korean labor movements.
