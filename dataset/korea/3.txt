S. Korea ruling party votes for presidential nominee

SEOUL (AFP) - South Korea's ruling conservative party voted on Sunday to decide its nominee for the presidential election in December, with the daughter of late dictator Park Chung Hee widely expected to win.

Tens of thousands of members of the New Frontier Party and select citizens chose one of five candidates, with the result to be announced at a party convention on Monday.

Ms Park Geun Hye, the 60-year-old daughter of Park Chung Hee, is almost certain to win.

A recent survey gave her a nearly 50 per cent approval for the party nomination. She has led opinion polls for months
