Park Geun-hye Nabs Saenuri Party Nomination

With only FOUR months remaining until the December 19th presidential election, Park Geun-hye has emerged victorious in the ruling Saenuri Party's primary.
Park, a former party chair and the eldest daughter of former president Park Chung Hee, is the first woman to win the nomination from the ruling party.
Among the party's five presidential contenders, Park grabbed first place with nearly 84 percent of the vote, while Kim Moon-soon came in second with 8.7 percent of the vote.
Of the approximately 200-thousand people eligible to vote in the primary -- including party delegates, rank-and-filed party members and the general public -- 82,6-hundred people cast ballots.
This was combined with the results of an opinion poll of some 6-thousand citizens.
Park will compete against the presidential candidate for the opposition camp once he or she is chosen in mid-September.
