South Korea's Ruling Party Elects Park Geun-hye As Presidential Candidate


(RTTNews) - Former president Park Chung-hee's daughter and ex-leader of the ruling Saenuri Party Park Geun-hye has been chosen as the presidential candidate with an overwhelming support at the national convention.

Running on a campaign of creating "a country where no-one is left behind," Park Geun-hye romped to a landslide victory on Monday securing 84 percent of votes, far ahead of four other contenders who shared the remaining votes between them.

South Korea never had a female President. She is also the first woman to be nominated by a major political party in the country to contest for the top post.

The victory of Park is credited to rebuilding of the party under her leadership and leading it to a surprise victory in the parliamentary elections held four months ago.

The 61-year-old presidential nominee has promised "a new era of unity of all people," by focusing on welfare policies and said that she will engage with North Korea if Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons program.

The main opposition Democratic United Party (DUP) has not finalized its candidate for the presidential election, which is due in December.

This was the second time Park bidding for presidential nominee, as she lost to incumbent Lee Myung-bak in the party's last primary in 2007.
