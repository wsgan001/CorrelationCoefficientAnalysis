Aspiring first female president a woman of principle

Park Geun-hye enters Korea's presidential race as the first woman to have won a major party's primary and the first child of a former president to run for the country's top elected office.

Her sweeping victory over four rivals from the ruling conservative Saenuri Party clears one hurdle on her path to December's presidential election, but the 60-year-old faces greater challenges ahead as she tries to widen her appeal among a public still divided about the 18-year authoritarian rule of her late father Park Chung-hee.

Born in 1952 as the eldest of three siblings, Park Geun-hye moved into the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae at the age of 11 when her father took office following a military coup he staged two years earlier.

She left for France in early 1974 to carry on her studies, but returned home that August after her mother, Yook Young-su, was killed in a bungled assassination attempt on her father by a pro-Pyongyang ethnic-Korean man from Japan.

Park spent the next five years serving as the acting first lady until her father was gunned down by his intelligence chief in 1979.

Her re-entry into political life came much later, in 1998, when she won a legislative seat in her hometown of Daegu as a member of the Grand National Party, which she renamed as the Saenuri Party early this year.

Park is currently serving her fifth consecutive term as a lawmaker. She previously ran for president in 2007 against incumbent President Lee Myung-bak and lost in the party primary.

The presidential nominee has built a reputation for sticking to principles and valuing trust, but critics take issue with her historical perspective surrounding her father's authoritarian rule and her apparent weakness in communicating with people both within the Saenuri Party, which she effectively controls, and with the general public.
