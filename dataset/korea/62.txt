Park Geun-hye Visits Grave of Former Presidents Including Roh Moo-hyun

A day after being nominated as the ruling conservative Saenuri Party's presidential candidate, Park Geun-hye paid a visit to the burial sites of the country's former presidents, including late President Roh Moo-hyun.
Park traveled to Bongha Village in Gimhae Tuesday afternoon, to pay her respect to President Roh who is still seen by many as an icon of the liberal camp, and also talked to his widow, and former First Lady Kwon Yang-sook.
Park's campaign said the trip was a part of her efforts to overcome regional and political barriers and promote national unity.
In response to her visit, President Roh's former chief of staff Moon Jae-in, who could be Park's main opponent in December's presidential election, called the visit positive but said he hoped it wasn't just a political attempt to garner more votes.
