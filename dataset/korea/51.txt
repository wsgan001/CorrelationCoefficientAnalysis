S Korea opposition hopeful sees summit with North

A leading presidential hopeful from South Korea・s main opposition party said Friday he would push for a summit with North Korea next year if elected.
Moon Jae-In, a human rights lawyer and top aide to late left-leaning president Roh Moo-Hyun, said he would also pursue a peace treaty formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War.

．If elected, I would immediately work on improving ties with North Korea,・ said Moon, seen as a front-runner for the Democratic United Party・s (DUP) nomination for the December presidential poll.

．I would hold an inter-Korean summit in the first year in office, around June 15,・ he told reporters.

The two Koreas held their first summit in 2000 on that date and signed a landmark agreement on reconciliation and exchanges. A second summit took place in 2007 between Roh and the North・s then-leader Kim Jong-Il.

Conservative President Lee Myung-Bak, who took office in 2008, ended Seoul・s policy of aid and engagement. He linked progress in the North・s nuclear disarmament to major aid, a stance that enraged Pyongyang.

Cross-border relations have been tense for years. In 2010 the South accused the North of being to blame for two deadly border incidents.

Moon, 60, said Lee・s ．hostile policy of confrontation・ towards Pyongyang had failed, intensifying the nuclear standoff and ruining burgeoning reconciliation.

．Better inter-Korean ties would bring better chances of resolving the nuclear issue as well,・ he said.

The DUP holds its presidential primary late next month.

The ruling New Frontier Party starts its two-day primary Sunday and is almost certain to pick Park Geun-Hye, daughter of former authoritarian president Park Chung-Hee.

Ahn Cheol-Soo, a popular left-leaning software entrepreneur, has not formally declared his intention to run for president, possibly as an independent.

But opinion polls put him close to Park, with Moon far behind.
