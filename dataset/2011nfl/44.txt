Patriots clip Ravens to reach Super Bowl

FOXBOROUGH, Massachusetts (Reuters) - The New England Patriots edged the Baltimore Ravens 23-20 on Sunday to reach the Super Bowl after Billy Cundiff hooked a potential game-tying field goal left of the upright in the final seconds of the game.

The hard-fought American Football Championship game looked headed for overtime after Baltimore marched down the field in the final minute as quarterback Joe Flacco connected repeatedly with wide receiver Anquan Boldin.

But two great defensive plays by New England safety Sterling Moore kept Baltimore from getting into the end zone and Cundiff missed a 32-yard field goal attempt with 11 seconds left to give the Patriots to their fifth Super Bowl berth since 2002.

"Just got to give all the credit to the players," Patriots coach Bill Belichick told the Gillette Stadium crowd during ceremonies on field. "Those guys fought all year, just like today. It wasn't all perfect but they fought to the final gun and came out on top."

The Patriots, who have won 10 consecutive games dating back to the regular season, will play the winner of Sunday's National Football Conference championship between the San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants in the National Football League's (NFL) title game on February 5 in Indianapolis.

Baltimore took a 20-16 lead late in the third quarter on a 39-yard field goal by Cundiff, but quarterback Tom Brady's one-yard scoring dive early in the fourth quarter put the Patriots ahead for good.

Brady completed 22-of-36 passes for 239 yards but failed to deliver any touchdown passes and threw two interceptions against the stingy Ravens defense.

"I sucked pretty bad today but our defense saved us," Brady said. "I am going to try and come out and do a better job in a couple weeks."
