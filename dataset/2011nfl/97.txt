The New York Giants take on the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game

AFTER a season of finesse football, things will get ugly when the New York Giants and the San Francisco 49ers face each other this morning in the NFC Championship Game for the right to go to Super Bowl XLVI.

Two of the most physical teams in football will pound on each other for more than three hours in the mud at San Francisco's Candlestick Park to see who will play the winner of New England and Baltimore in the Super Bowl.

"This is not going to be a cute football game," Giants defensive tackle Chris Canty said. "It's not going to be for the meek and mild.

"This is going to be a blood bath. They don't try to make it a secret, they try to beat you up. We pride ourselves on being a physical football team. Something's gotta give."

The 49ers game revolves around workhorse running back Frank Gore and their stifling defence line-up, while the Giants rely on superstar quarterback Eli Manning and dangerous targets in Hakeem Nicks, Victor Cruz and Mario Manningham.

But they also want to be considered the tough guys, even against the very impressive 49ers.
