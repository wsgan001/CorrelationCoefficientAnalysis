Giants' Manning back at practice after one-day bug

EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (Reuters) - New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning returned to practice on Thursday after a stomach bug forced him to miss a workout a day earlier ahead of Sunday's NFC championship game against the San Francisco 49ers.

Manning, enjoying the best season of his National Football League career, went through the whole range of practice at the Giants' training facility to stay on course for the showdown in San Francisco that will send the winner to the Super Bowl.

The New York quarterback, named Most Valuable Player of the Giants' Super Bowl triumph four years ago, has thrown six touchdown passes and just one interception in opening playoff wins against the Atlanta Falcons and Green Bay Packers.
