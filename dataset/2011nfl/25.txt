Patriots QB Brady makes return to practice

(Reuters) - New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady returned to practice on Thursday after sitting out the prior day's workout to rest his left, non-throwing shoulder ahead of Sunday's AFC title game against the Baltimore Ravens.

The three-time Super Bowl winner, who tied a National Football League playoff record with six touchdown passes in last week's win over the Denver Broncos, said he will be as prepared as he can be for Sunday's game.

"When coach (Bill Belichick) feels it's best that you do other things to get yourself ready, that's what you do and you still use all that time very wisely," Brady told reporters ahead of Thursday's practice.

"You don't go lounging around taking naps or anything like that. You're just putting in extra work and making sure you're getting prepared."

The top-seeded Patriots host the second-ranked Ravens on Sunday with the winner advancing to the Super Bowl on February 5 in Indianapolis.
