Alas, San Francisco 49ers Won't Head To Super Bowl

During a suspenseful game that went into overtime, the New York Giants beat the San Francisco 49ers 20-17 for the NFC Championship title. This means that, sadly, SF won't advance to the Super Bowl. "Thanks to two fumbled punt returns by Kyle Williams - one in the fourth quarter and the other in overtime," points out The Chronicle.

"I¡¦m proud of the way we played, the way we competed," 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh said during a post-game press conference. "It wasn¡¦t there for us today. ¡K In a lot of ways, we played well enough to win and didn¡¦t."

SFist football scribe Daisy Barringer will have more later today on Sunday's devastating loss.
