NFC Championship: New York Giants @ San Francisco 49ers 

New York Giants @ San Francisco 49ers Sun. Jan. 22, 2012 6:30 p.m. EST

Arguably the most anticipated matchup of the NFL Conference Championships this weekend will take place this Sunday in the Bay Area with the New York Giants traveling across the country to take on the defensive-minded San Francisco 49ers. Even though the Giants have played extremely well over the last month or so with impressive wins over the Dallas Cowboys, Atlanta Falcons and the defending Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers, Eli Manning and company will be the underdogs on Sunday as they will be going up against arguably the best defense left in the NFL playoffs.

The San Francisco 49ers may have been the underdogs at home against the red-hot New Orleans Saints last weekend in the NFC Divisional round, but that didn¡¦t stop Alex Smith and company having one of the best performances of the season to pull off the slight upset in the Bay Area. This weekend the 49ers will go head-to-head against an evenly matched opponent with the Giants coming to town.

The Giants might be the superior team in terms of offense with Pro Bowl quarterback Eli Manning at the top of his game with up-and-coming receivers Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks at his disposal in the passing game, but the defenses are neck and neck in terms of talent. The 49ers probably have the better defense on paper, but the Giants do have the advantage in terms of experience in the playoffs.

Needless to say, this could be a very entertaining football game this weekend with the Super Bowl on the line in San Francisco. As of right now, the 49ers have been given the slight edge with a -3 point spread and I believe that is right on the money.

Take the 49ers at -3.
