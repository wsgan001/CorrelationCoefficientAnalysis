Former San Francisco 49ers Cornerback Tells Team to Kick New York Giants¡¦ Face In

The San Francisco 49ers have it in their heads that the New York Giants are "cocky." They've been led to believe that Big Blue has done all sorts of talking this week and that it's a sign of disrespect. It's gone so far that former 49ers have decided to chime in on this alleged trash talk and offer their two cents. That includes one-time San Francisco 49ers cornerback Eric Wright, who believe the 49ers should "kick their face in."

    ¡§That¡¦s what the Giants are doing ¡V they¡¦re talking crap,¡¨ Wright said. ¡§OK, so the Niners are not getting their respect. But don¡¦t talk back, don¡¦t tweet, don¡¦t talk crap. That¡¦s what you do when you have a good team. Just go out there and kick their face in.¡¨

The true irony of the situation is that members of the Giants have said very little this week; they've merely noted their own personal confidence. On the other hand, it was the 49ers who openly hoped for the Giants as opposed to the Green Bay Packers, and whose star tight end, Vernon Davis, already has his NFC Championship celebration planned. That's not to mention former wide receiver Jerry Rice calling Brandon Jacobs "soft" and Jim Harbaugh having film study done on the Packers prior to the Giants/Packers game.

If this is what the 49ers need to motivate themselves, they're grasping for straws. This game will determine the NFC Champion and NFC representative in the Super Bowl and that's all an athlete should need to perform at their highest level. A sure sign of fear and nervousness is forcing made-up trash talk down the throats of your coaches and teammates.

The Giants are relaxed and confident going into Sunday. The 49ers, on the other hand, appear afraid.
