Ravens won't lean on 2009 playoff win vs. Patriots

The Ravens may be 1-6 all time against the New England Patriots, but that one win took place in the postseason after the 2009 regular season. The Ravens traveled to Foxborough, Mass., and routed New England, 33-14, on Jan. 10, 2010.

But coach John Harbaugh said that victory won・t mean much to the current squad.

：A lot will be made of it, but I really don・t think it does mean too much,； he said Monday. ：We・ve been over there for a number of losses, too, in the regular season. So all of that becomes part of who you are as a team.；

Outside linebacker Jarret Johnson echoed that sentiment.

：Every game is different,； he said. ：You can・t rely on the last game to get you through the next game. The last four times we have played them, going back to [2007], all of them have been wars. Even though they have won three of the four, they had to earn it. This one is not going to be any different. It・s going to be, obviously, an extremely intense situation, environment, and we・re looking forward to it. It・s going to be fun.；
