Tim Tebow played through "considerable pain" against Patriots

(CBS/AP) - The New England Patriots dominated the Denver Broncos in every facet of the AFC divisional playoff game last Saturday. The reasons for that are numerous, but one that is only recently coming to light is the fact that Denver quarterback Tim Tebow was playing with an injury. A Broncos team spokesperson said that Tebow was playing with "considerable pain" after a third quarter hit that tore cartilage in his first rib and bruised his lung.

An NFL source told ESPN that Tebow suffered an injury to his chest that tore a rib and caused fluid buildup in his pleural cavity - the area of the torso below the lungs.

Tebow was reportedly in so much pain that he had trouble sleeping over the weekend. He had an MRI on his chest Monday.

Team spokesman Patrick Smyth said that while he couldn't confirm the exact extent or nature of the injuries due to team policy, he acknowledged that Tebow finished the game in considerable pain.

Backup Brady Quinn got ready after Tebow was hit by Vince Wilfork and Rob Ninkovich, but Tebow stayed in.

The Broncos eventually lost to the Patriots 45-10.

The injuries aren't expected to interfere with Tebow's offseason training program.
