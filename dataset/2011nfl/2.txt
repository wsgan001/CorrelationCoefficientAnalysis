Patriots and Ravens set for classic gridiron clash

(Reuters) - While the NFC divisional playoffs provided two surprises, action in the AFC went according to script as the New England Patriots and Baltimore Ravens will square off in a battle of the top two seeds for a ticket to the Super Bowl.

The New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers added some spice to the National Football League (NFL) postseason with respective wins over the defending Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers and New Orleans Saints but the Patriots (13-3) and Ravens (12-4) were as reliable as their records.

Patriots quarterback Tom Brady put on a clinic with six touchdown passes to tie an NFL playoff record in a 45-10 win over the Denver Broncos on Saturday.

The next day the Ravens flexed their defensive muscle in stopping the Houston Texans 20-13 to set up a classic showdown at New England's Gillette Stadium on January 22 where an offensive powerhouse will meet a ferocious defense.

"There's no one that's going to overlook a team like that. It would be impossible to do," Brady told Boston sports radio station WEEI on Monday. "They present a ton of challenges in all three phases of the game.

"You watch them yesterday, they're physical, they're tough, they can cover. They've got some of the best players in the history of the NFL at their position.

"We've really got our work cut out for us.

"We'll use the week to prepare like we always do, and really try to be at our best -- hopefully be better than we were this past Saturday night."

Brady will need to come up with something magical if the two-time Super Bowl most valuable player is to top the numbers her put up against the overmatched Broncos.
