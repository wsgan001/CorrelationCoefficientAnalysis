Giants edge 49ers to set up Pats rematch

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The New York Giants again proved their resilience on the road by reaching the Super Bowl with a 20-17 overtime victory over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday in the National Football Conference championship game.

A 31-yard field goal by Lawrence Tynes at a damp Candlestick Park sealed a hard-fought victory for the Giants, who last won the Super Bowl over the New England Patriots four years ago with an improbable run to the title as a wild card.

Tynes, who also kicked a game-winning field goal to send New York to their previous Super Bowl, split the uprights after the Giants had gained a decisive turnover in San Francisco territory after a fumbled punt return by back-up receiver Kyle Williams.

"I was so nervous today before the game just anticipating this kind of game," Tynes told reporters. "I'm usually pretty cool but there was something about tonight that I knew I was going to have to make a kick."

Giants coach Tom Coughlin tipped his hat to his team for the late Williams turnover, forced by Jacquian Williams and recovered by Devin Thomas.

"That play at the end of the game was unbelievable, just to give us a chance of winning," Coughlin said after the Giants' fifth straight victory on the road.

"Otherwise it was a defensive struggle and no team was able to really move the ball."

The Giants, who made the playoffs after winning the regular season finale three weeks ago, will face the American Football Conference champion Patriots in the National Football League's title game in Indianapolis on February 5.
