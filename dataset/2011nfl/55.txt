Where is best place for New York Giants quarterback, Hoboken resident Eli Manning to get soup to combat "stomach bug"?

New York Giants quarterback and Hoboken resident Eli Manning missed part of yesterday¡¦s practice session with an illness that coach Tom Coughlin called ¡§a stomach bug, hopefully a 24-hour deal¡¨, according to reports yesterday.

Manning was placed on the Giants' injury report for the first time this season. The team is preparing to play the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday for the NFC championship.

"If there is one guy who can miss a practice Wednesday mentally, it's No. 10," guard Chris Snee said of Manning, who has had his best pro season. "He was probably in here on Monday and Tuesday looking at film."

Snee offered some help to make sure Manning was feeling better today.

"I'm actually going to bring him some soup tomorrow," Snee said. "I'll do whatever it takes to make sure he is at full strength."

So what are some other soup options in Hoboken for Eli?

If he wants a healthy selection of soups (and bread), he can head to the Panera Bread located on Washington Street.

If he has a taste for something a little closer to his home, Turning Point on Frank Sinatra Drive may suit his needs.

That brings us to this question of the morning: What would be the best soup place for the New York Giants quarterback to head to in Hoboken for a speedy recovery in time for Sunday's NFC Championship Game?
