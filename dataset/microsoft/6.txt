Microsoft loses $300 million Supreme Court case

The United States Supreme Court handed Microsoft a stinging defeat in its appeal of a $300 million patent case verdict, according to Bloomberg. Back in 2007, I4i LP sued the computer giant, claiming that its patented technology had been illegally used in Microsoft Word, the popular word-processing program. Apple and Google had supported Microsoft¡¦s legal effort to reverse the ruling, but the Court was unanimous, 8-0, in its support of the initial verdict. (Chief Justice John Roberts, who owns Microsoft stock, removed himself from the case.)

¡§While the outcome is not what we had hoped for, we will continue to advocate for changes to the law that will prevent abuse of the patent system and protect inventors who hold patents representing true innovation,¡¨ said Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman, in an e-mail to Bloomberg.
