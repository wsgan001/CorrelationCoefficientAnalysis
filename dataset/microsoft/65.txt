Microsoft patent infringement case costs company $300 million

Patent infringement cases have been escalating in recent years between technology firms as they look to secure the next great idea behind their products and services.

Some cases end up in settlements and some result to hefty fines. The latter was the case in the patent infringement claim filed by Toronto-based i4i LP against Microsoft Corp.

The U.S. Supreme Court brought the hammer down on Microsoft today, ordering the technology titan to pay a fine of $300 million. The decision upheld an earlier ruling by a lower court.

At the center of the patent infringement claim is a feature in Microsoft Word which let users add special data to files such as customer forms. I4i claimed that Microsoft stole the method and incorporated it into Word.

Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said that it took more than a year for i4i to file the patent after it used it in one of its products, thereby making the innovation ineligible for a patent.

The lower court sided with i4i, and originally ordered Microsoft to pay $200 million and to stop using the invention. The Supreme Court added another $100 million in interest to that amount. Microsoft had since made some changes to its Word productivity software.

The outcome of the patent infringement case of i4i against Microsoft was considered a landmark decision with ¡§huge implications for all patent owners that assert their patents,¡¨ said i4i lawyer Robert Sterne.

¡§There was a lot of uncertainty in patent litigation over validity challenges and whether there was going to be a new standard of proof,¡¨ he added.

The patent infringement decision is said to affect many future cases not only in the technology sector but other industries as well.
