Mexico's election results up for court challenge

The second-placed candidate in Mexico's presidential election, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, says he will challenge the result in court. 

Mr Obrador says he will prove that illicit money was used to buy votes and secure the victory of centrist candidate Enrique Pena Nieto. 

Mr Pena Nieto has denied the allegation. 

Mr Pena Nieto was confirmed the winner last Friday after a final recount gave him 38.2 per cent of the vote, compared to the 31.5 per cent secured by Mr Obrador. 

The National Action Party¡¦s candidate Josefina Vazquez Mota, who finished third in the poll, has accepted defeat.
