Thousands Protest Results of Mexican Presidential Election

Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets of Mexico City Saturday to protest the presidential election win by Enrique Pena Nieto, accusing him and his party of widespread vote-buying. 

The protesters, including students and leftists, accuse Pena Nieto and his Institutional Revolutionary Party - the PRI - of buying the election win by handing out gift cards and groceries to thousands of people in return for their votes in the July 1 polls.

Runner-up Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who finished nearly seven percentage points behind Mr. Pena Nieto, said he will file a formal legal challenge to the vote count in electoral courts this week.
