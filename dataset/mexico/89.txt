Mexican leftists to defy Nieto's win in court

"We'll go to the Electoral Court in the coming days, within the appropriate time frame," said PRD chairman Jesus Zambrano on Sunday. 

Zambrano¡¦s comments came after the Federal Electoral Institute on Sunday confirmed the victory of Nieto after recounting nearly half the ballots.

PRD and its candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who came in second in the July 1 vote, accused Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of having bought the votes. 

Pena Nieto denies the allegation and PRI officials have threatened to sue Lopez Obrador over the accusation. 

On Saturday, tens of thousands of Mexicans in the capital, Mexico City, demonstrated against the result of the presidential election. 

Lopez Obrador, who led major protests after the 2006 presidential polls, said he is collecting evidence of fraud to give to the officials and called on the conservative National Action Party (PAN) to join forces with him to take legal action. 

Mexico's electoral tribunal is to evaluate any complaints by September and officially name the country¡¦s new president.
