Election protest draws crowd to Tijuana's Rio Zone

TIJUANA ¡X For the second time in a week, crowds of demonstrators swarmed the city¡¦s Rio Zone on Saturday to protest Mexico¡¦s July 1 elections, alleging fraud and other electoral irregularities that they said unfairly favored winning candidate Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico¡¦s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).

Many carried home-made signs that complained of purchased votes, complicit media, and corrupt politicians. Some were witty, others angry. ¡§Mexico has awakened,¡¨ read one sign. ¡§Turn off your TV and turn on your mind,¡¨ stated another.

¡§Many things were done behind people¡¦s backs,¡¨ said Manuel Aramburo, a 19-year-old engineering student at the Instituto Tecnologico de Tijuana. Electoral officials ¡§ignored the the complaints¡¨ of irregularities during the campaign, said Jorge Rodriguez, a 20-year-old economics student at the Autonomous University of Baja California.

Many members of the largely young crowd gathered at the Cuauhtemoc traffic circle identified themselves as members of the national #yosoy132 student movement formed in the weeks leading up to the election.

The peaceful protest mirrored similar demonstrations Saturday in other parts of Mexico, including Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Chihuahua, and Oaxaca.

Tijuana's gathering culminated in a march to Fifth Street and Avenida Revolucion that had people pouring through the city's streets in the largest protest in recent memory.
