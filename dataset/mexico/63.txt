Thousands in Mexico Protest Against Presidential Election

Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the Mexican capital yesterday to show their disdain towards President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto, MSNBC is reporting. The protesters have accused him of paying TV networks for support and buying votes. The demonstrators shouted their disapproval of Pena Nieto・s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the electoral authority.
The PRI was previously in power in Mexico for seven decades, during which officials were accused of rigging elections. Accusations of Pena Nieto・s vote-buying initially surfaced in June. They intensified after people on the outskirts of Mexico City received pre-paid gift cards worth about 100 pesos, or $7.50. Many said they received the cards from PRI supporters.
Pena Nieto won the election held on July 1 by almost seven percentage points, according to the official count. He・s due to begin his term in December, replacing Felipe Calderon of the conservative National action Party (PAN). The PAN candidate running against Pena Nieto, Josefina Vazquez Mota, finished two spots behind Pena Nieto, in third place.
Pena Nieto・s major competition, leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who came in second place, has refused to concede. He has accused Pena Nieto of stealing the position, but the President-elect denies any wrongdoing. PRI officials are pondering whether to sue Lopez Obrador over his accusations.
Mexico・s electoral tribunal has until September to evaluate any complaints. If they decide Pena Nieto officially and legally won, they・ll officially name him as the next president.
