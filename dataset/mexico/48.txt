Thousands protest Nieto's victory in Mexican presidential election

MEXICO CITY, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people took to the streets in Mexico City on Saturday to protest the presidential election victory of Enrique Pena Nieto, accusing him of massive vote-buying.

The march started from the famous Angel Monument and ended at the downtown square Zocalo.

The marchers, most of whom were youngsters, shouted "get out Pena" and "fraud, fraud, fraud," and claimed that Nieto, from the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), used pre-paid cards to buy millions of votes.

Some people held up posters reading "TV network is yours, but streets are ours" to blame the PRI's irregularities including biased media coverage.

Nieto has flatly denied any vote-rigging in the election.

The protesters also accused the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) of "holding an unfair election."

Nieto's closet rival Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, from the center-left Progressive Movement, had denounced the presidential election held last Sunday as being "plagued by irregularities."

The IFE, therefore, had reopened and recounted ballot boxes from half of the more than 100,000 voting stations around the nation.

The IFE on Friday finally confirmed Nieto's victory in the election. Final statistics showed Nieto gained 38.21 percent of the votes against 31.59 percent for Obrador.

The other candidates except Obrador had conceded defeat.

However, Obrador said he was not behind Saturday's march
